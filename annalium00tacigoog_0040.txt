trates to the senate¹. The people may probably have felt that
the substance of power had long since departed from them, and
that only the shadow had now followed it: at any rate, the
change took place without serious opposition‚ and the populace
were left with nothing henceforth to care for but their bread and
their amusements²
With the senate it was outwardly far otherwise. In place of
the‘ senatus populusque Romanus,' in whose name the acts of
Rome used to run, this august body alone remained, with ap-
parently still more than its ancient majesty. ‘ Affa1rs that con·-
cerned the state, and the most important affairs which concerned
individuals ⁸‚’ were still handled by it with apparent freedom;
its decrees come to differ only in form from laws 3 in choosing
magistrates, who by virtue of such magistracy become senators ⁴,
it is formally a sels-elective body; in form even the right of
choosing the princeps himself devolves upon it⁶3 the whole
narrative of Tacitus is full of its debates and decisions. As of
old, it awards triumphal honours ⁰ and other recognition of vic-
tories ⁷, and sends its thanks or rewards to allied kings as repre-
sentative of the state⁸; it decrees public funerals⁹ and other
honours to the dead¹⁰; it makes regulations to repress disorder¹¹,
and curb extravagance¹² and immorality¹⁸, and to deal stringently
with the abuses of religious ¹⁴ or superstitious practices ¹⁶3 while,
abroad‚ all important questions appertaining to the adminis-
tration of its own provinces are referred to it ; one such
occasion, that of the deputation from Asia on the right of sanc-
tuary‚ being described as unusually impressive¹⁶. Besides all
this, the senate has supplanted the praetor’s tribunal as the
{great high court of criminal justice ¹⁷, before which culprits of
rank are almost always arraigned‚ especially on the constantly
recurring charge of ‘ maiestas?
