NOTES. BOOK IV. CHAPS. 23-28. 359

1. 17. deportarat, used by zeugma with ‘ caedem ducis ' in the sense
of ‘ had achieved.'

1. 19. set culpae nescia. If this reading be correct, it must be taken
to mean that the people were not cognisant of the action of their king
(c. 23, 2), but feared it might be visited upon them. Other readings,
giving an opposite sense, have been suggested.

1. 21. repetitusff was revived?

1. 22. antiqua patrum munera. Such gists are recorded as sent to
Masinissa through Scipio (Liv.3o.15,11). Vergil describes somewhat
similar presents (Aen. 7. 246; 11. 334).

1. 25. c. 27. mota . . . semina, ‘ the seeds already scattered.’

1. 28. positis= ‘propositis,' ‘ published:' cp. 1. 7, 5.

l. 29. longinquos, probably best taken as ‘ remote,' i. e. distant from
any such town as Brundisium. The alternative translation ‘ extensive’
may derive support from the meaning of ‘longinquitas ⁹ in 3. 5, 4, etc.

1. 3ο. biremes, the smaller class of war ships (‘Liburnae’) from the
fleet at Ravenna.

1. 32. provincia . . . calles evenerant. Certain quaestorial ‘ pro·
vinciae ' (‘districts’) existed in Italy down to the time of ClaudiuS, who
finally abolished them. One took its name from Ostia, and had important
duties connected with the corn trade. Another, called ‘ Gallica,‘ com-
prehended north-east Italy; and there were probably at least two others.
If the MS. text is correct, it is possible that the quaestorial duty in
this district was connected with the rent of public pastures: many
read ⁴ Cales,' supposing that the ‘provincia’ was designated from that
town.

l. 33. classiariorum, the marines (ἐπιβάται) from these ships.

coeptantem cum maxime, ‘at its very outset ε ’ cp. 3. 59, 4.

1³. 181, 1. 4. multitudinem familiarum: cp. 3. 53, 5.

inmensum, adverbial: cp. 3. 30, 2, etc.

1. 7. c. 28. Vibius Serenus. On the father, see 2. 3ο, 1; on his
banishment, c. 13, 2. The son is mentioned again in c. 36, 4.

1. 10. comparatur,‘ is matchedss a figure from the gladiatorial arena.
Another reading, rather nearer to the MS. text, is ‘pater orante filio:
praeparatus adolescens,' etc.

l. 11. in Galliam, probably during the rebellion of A. D. 21 (3. 40-
46), at which time Serenus would have been proconsul in Spain.

1. 12. adnectebat, absol„ as in 2. 26, 5.

l. 17. quandoque, ⁶ at some time:‘ cp. 1. 4, 5.

1. 19. falso. Some retain the MS. ‘ falsa,’ which might be taken aa ,
ο2, Greek accus.‚ like ‘inscripti nomina . . . floreS,’ Verg. Ecl. 3. 106.

proderentur, probably ironical. If ‘divulged,’ they would at once
clear themselves, and discredit the whole charge.
