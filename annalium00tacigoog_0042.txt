and considerable portion of Algeria ; its chief cities being Utica
and the new Julian colony of Carthage.

For the proconsulship of these two great provinces lots were
drawn annually by the two senior consulars who had not pre-
viously held either ¹. The other senatorial provinceS, eight or
nine in number ², were similarly allotted to annual governorS,
also styled proconsuIS, though usually only of praetorian rank.
Their dutieS, as a rule, were civil only, nor are any soldierS,
except a few by way of police, to be found generally in these
provinces ⁸. Besides the assistance of one or more legati of
high senatorial rank, each proconsul was attended by a quae-
stor, who received all sums due to the aerarium at Rome.
support οἷ’ῐὶιε fiscuS, comprised all those fronting the enemies
of the empire, and many other important countries. Their
governorS, appointed directly by the princepS, held office during
his pleasure, usually for from three to five years, but often for
much longer periods ⁴, and, like proconsuls of senatorial pro-
vinces, had the assistance of ‘legati,’ as also of a ‘ procurator
fisci,’ whose duties answered to those of the quaestor. Holding
often the command of large armieS, and having much fuller
power of life and death ⁵, these governors were in a far higher
real position than that of a senatorial proconsu13 although, in
recognition of the sole ‘ proconsulare imperium ² of Caesar, none
had a higher title than that of ‘legatus Augusti propraetore?

To the greatest provinceS, in which large forces were sta·
tioned, legati of consular rank were always sent ⁶. Foremost

² Those usually so reckoned were Sicily, Sardinia (with Corsica),
Hispania Baetica, Gallia NarbonensiS, Macedonia, Achaia, Bithynia,
CypruS, and Crete (with Cyrene); but some of these were at times κ
given over to Caesar. See 1. 76, 4, and note on 2. 85, 5.

³ Africa formed an exception to this rule, havinga regular force of
one legion, to which, during part of the war with TacfarinaS, a second
was added (see on 4. 5, 3). ⁴ See 1. 80, 2.

⁸ senatorial proconsuls could not (except in Africa) execute a soldier;
and any citizen, under a capital charge, could appeal from·any governor
to Caesar. A well-known instance is that of St. Paul (Acts m. 1 1).

⁶ Besides those here mentioned, Hispania Tarraconensis, Moesia,
Pannonia, and Dalmatia, belonged at the time of Tiberius to this class.
