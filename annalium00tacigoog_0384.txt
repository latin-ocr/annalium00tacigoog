answering to ‘lascivia epularum,’ or might be abl. of manner, equivalent

niscence of Verg. Aen. 9. 236.

1. 25. adpugnarent: cp. 2. 81, 1.

1. 26. suc . . . periculo, perhaps best taken as forming a climax

trasted with ‘e ducibus Dinis: ‘Tantum his' is a correction for the
MS. ‘ quamviS, ’ which gives no satisfactory sense.

1. 24. properum finem. The construction is designedly exclamatory,
as in 1. 35, 2; 41, 2, εἴας but the sense os such a participle as ‘’suadens
