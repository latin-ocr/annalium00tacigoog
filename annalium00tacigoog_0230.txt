2 16 TA CI TUS .· A NNALS.

-ρ, 14, ς 23. sse defeat of Varus in Λα). 9- is osten alluded to in this
Book (see esp. c. 61).

1. 5. voeabula, ‘ titles.’ All the old magistracieS, except the censor-
ship, continued to exist, but it is implied that they were mere names.
1. 8. rempublicam, used emphatically, as in 4. 19, 3, of a constitn-

tion that could truly δςῖοιι112ι1 republican. ‘Vidisset’ is apparently a a· Ρ

potential subjunct.

1. ιο. ο. 4. aequalitate. The use of this word for politieal equality
(ἰσοτιμία) appears to be peculiar to Tacitus: cp. 3. 26, 3; 74, 6.

1. 13. aegro et corpore. ‘’Et has here the force of‘ etiam?

1.14. in cassum, ‘ idly, ’ as mere declamation.

1. 16. dominos. ,differebant=‘ rumores differebant de dominis?
unless, perhaps, ‘differre’ has the force of‘ to pull to pieces,’ as in Verg.
Aen. 8. 643, etc.

l. 17. experientia. The use of this word ιιι the sense of‘ knowledge
gained by practice ’ is almost wholly Vergilian (G. 1. 4, etc.) and
Tacitean (c. 46, 2, etc.).

l. 18. moli parem: so ⁶ par negotiis? 3. 30, 5, etc„ and ‘ moles‚’ of
the weight of empire, c. 11, 2.

maturum annis, etc. Tiberius was then fifty-six, and had held
important military commands during many years, especially in the sup-
pression of the great Illyrian revolt, Aa). 6-9, and in Germany before
and aster the defeat of Varus·

l. 21. regnati-ico, ἅπ. cip„ but one of a common class of new words
in Tacitus (Introd. p. 18, 5 43) t here used invidiously of the ‘domus
principis! TiberiuS, on his father's death, passed, at nine years old,
under the tutelage of his stepfather (B.C. 33). He was consul at the age
of twenty-nine, and again at that of thirty-five, and received triumphal
honours on three occasionS.

1. 22. ne iis quidem annis, etc. He had lived in retirement at
Rhodes from ΒΕ. 6 to A.D. 2, partly owing to the conduct of h‘is wife
(see c. 53, 2), partly to avoid rivalry with Gaius and LuciuS. ‘Agere'
has often the force of ⁶ degere,’ as in 2. 42, 2 ; 3. 48, 2, etc.

1. 25. inpotentia, ‘imperiousness ’ (abl. of quality). From denoting
absence of sels-control, the word acquires here the sense of violent as-
sertion of sels-will. It is used again of Livia in 4. 57. 4³ cp. ‘inpotensss
3·'33‚ 42 etc·

duobus, Germanicus and Drusus

l. 26. qui rempublicam, etc. They would be an encumbrance, by
monopolising the chief positions in the state, for the present, and dis-
tract it, by disputing the succession, in the future. ‘’Quandoque has
the sense of‘ at some time’ in 4. 28, 3.

l. 28. e. 5. agitantibus, best taken as a concise abl. abs.: see Introd.
