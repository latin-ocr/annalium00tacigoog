234 ' TA CJTUS: ANNALS.

l. 6. potius quam, etc. Τὴε construction is an abbreviation for
‘ potius quam ita victurum, ut,’ etc.

l. 7. deferebat . . . ni: see Introd. p. 16, § 32. ’

l. 9. quidam singuli, in contrast with ‘ conglobata,’ as ⁴ propius in-
cedentes ’ with ‘ extrema pars?

1. 11. addito, abl. aba: see Introd. p. 12, ξ 19 a.

1. 14. c. 36. etenim. This introduces considerations which made
the need of remedial measures more pressing.

1. 15. superiorem: see c. 31, 2.

1. 16. oppidum, their chief town. Agrippina, daughter os Ger·
manicus and mother of Ner0, was subsequently born there; and through
her influence the town became ⁶ Colonia Agrippinensis ; ’ whence the
modern name, Koln or Cologne.

1. 17. manus, best taken as ‘ troops ; ’ this meaning being required
by ‘ erupturas,’ and the metaphor being similar to that of H. 3. 15, 4,
‘ Ut civili praeda milites imbuerentur.’

l. 18. gnarus . . . hostis, ‘ the fact that the enemy was aware.'
The adj. has here the usage noted with participles in Introd. p. 16,

L 2ο. suscipi. The construction still depends on ⁶ augebat metum!

severitas, ‘ rigour,’ apparently in the sense of ‘ peremptor-y refusal '
(cp. c. 25, 3), explained by ‘ seu nihil’ below, as ‘largitio ’ by ⁸ sive
omnia concederentur.’

l. 24. missionem, ‘full discharge: '⁷ cp. c. 37, 1 ; 52, 1, etc.

exauctorari. This verb would also naturally imply full release,
but is here qualified by the context, so as to mean discharge from the
ranks of the legion to the condition of a ‘vexillarius ’ (c. 17, 4). Similar
qualification attaches to ‘dimissis’ (1.1.), ‘missi ’ (c. 39, 2). and ‘di-
mitterentur ' (c. 78, 2). The freedom from camp duties would seem to
have been a new concession, not a standing privilege of the veterana

1. 28. e. 37. in tempus: cp. ⁴ ad tempus,‘ c. 1, 2.

‘collecta viatica‚’ Hor. Epp. 2. 2, 26.

1. 33. civitatem Ubiorum. Τὴεγ were already ‘in finibus Ubiorum ’
(c. 31, 3), so that ‘ civitas ’ here probably means the ‘oppidum' (c. 36, 1).

P. 6 1. 1. de imperatore rapti. These words are emphatic, and
exp am turpi agmine,’ the deposition of money with the standards

for safe keeping being not in itself unusual.
