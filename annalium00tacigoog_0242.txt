2 2 8 TA CI TUS .· ANNALS.

l. 3²· cognomento. This was probably his real name (cp. 2. 9, ²3
60, 3, etc.), as nicknames are generally explained (see above, and
ct 41² 3)·

1. 33. morti deposcit, ‘ demands for death,’ i. e. with a view to his
death: ›cp. ⁴ incessit itineri et proelio,’ c. 51, 4, and the phrase ‘receptui
canere.' This usage is akin to the gerundive dat. noted in Introd.
p. 1 1, § 1 1.

P. 57 1. 3. o. 24. abstrusum, ‘ reserved.’ This word appears to be
here alone used of persons, analogously to the more common use of
⁴ tectus‚' ⁴ occultus,’ etc.

l. 5. primoribus civitatis: cp. 3. 65, 3. The most distinguished of
those sent was Cn. Lentulus (c. 37, 1).

l. 6. ex re, ⁴ in accordance with circumstances: ’ so ‘ ex memoria,’
2. 63, 13 ‘ ex delicto,’ 3. 37, 3; and the common expressions ⁴ ex sen-
tentia‚’ etc.

l. 8. Germanorum. A body-guard of German horsemen, set up by
Augustus, had been dismissed by him after the defeat of Varus, but ap·
parently restored before the end of his life.

1. 10. Seianus, here first mentioned. His early history is given in
4. 1 ; his father was mentioned in c. 7, 3.

l. 11. ceteris periculorum praemiorumque ostentator, ‘ to hold
before the rest their perils and rewards.’ The context seems to show
that ‘ ceteri’ are not the legions, but the troops sent from Rome,
whom he was to warn how much they had to gain or lose by their
behaviour.

l. 12. per officium, ‘ by way of respect.’

1. 14. insignibus, ‘ the decorations,' or ‘ dona militaria’ (cp. c. 44,
7 ; 3. 21, 3), which formed the full dress of the Roman soldier.

1. 16. e. 25. portas . . . firmant, etc. Some part of the escort of
Drusus appea1s to have entered with him (c. 37, 1), but the main body
would appear to have remained outside (c. 30, 1, and note on c. 37, 3),
and may have been quartered in the winter camp, which appears to
have been at no great distance.

l. 25. plurima bella. Tiberius had held command here ιιι Β. c, 1 2-9,
and 111 the great revolt of A. D. 6- —9.

l. 29. quem neque, etc.,‘ which should not be treated as having no
right to concede or to resist! ‘Severitas’ has probably the same sense
here as (in opposition to ‘largitio ‘) in c. 36, 3. Elsewhere it would
rather denote punishment, as in c. 46, 3, etc.

1. 32. o. 26. a sedecim: cp. c. 19, 4.

Qi- 3. arbitrium . . . obtenderet,‘ was pleading the authority,’
i. e. that they must decide on such requests. For this use of ‘ obtendere,'
cp. 3. 17, 23 35, 3, and ⁴ obtentui: c. 10, 1.
