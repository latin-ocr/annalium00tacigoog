NOTES. BOOK II. CHAPS. 33-35. 277

hypothetical sentences, is a Graecism: cp. Thuc. 4. 98, 4, εἲ μὲν ἐπὶ
πλέον δυνηθῆναι . . . κρατῆσαι, κ.τ.λ. This ironical use of ‘nisi forte’ is
comnlon in Sallust.

l. 24. sub nominibus honestis, taken closely with ‘ confessio viti-
orum ;’ ⁶ his admission of vices under specious names!

1. 26. censurae, such control as a censor might exercise.

1. 27. corrigendi auctorem. Tiberius was ⁸ corrector morum,' and
the censorship existed in no other form.

1. 28. ο. 34. 1.. Piso, mentioned again in 4. 21, 13 probably also in
c. 32, 4; 3. 11, 2 ; 68, 1 ς supposed to have been a brother of Cn. Piso.

fori. The law courts must be meant, as there were no elections by
the comitia (1. 15, 1); but ‘ corrupta ' may refer to bribery, ‘ ambitum’
to solicitation (cp. 1. 2, 2).

P. 102, 1. 2. Urgulania, mentioned again in 4. 21, 13 22, 3. We
gather that Piso claimed a sum of money from her, and, on her disre-
gard, would have dragged her to court by force from the house of
Caesar3 and that Tiberius. while offering to appear as her ‘ advocatus‚'
managed to gain time, during which Augusta paid the money into
court.

1. 6. hactenus, explained by ⁸ ut . . . diceret: ’ he could so far
gratify his mother, without doing more than any one citizen might do
for another (cp. 1. 12, 6, etc.).

l. 8. militibus, his usual guard: cp. 1. 7, 73 24, 3, etc.

1. 9. tempus atque iter, hendiadys ε ep. Introd. p. 19, ξ 48.

1· 12· nequ-0 ² ‘ne · · · qnidem3’ cP· c· 51, 3» 8²5 53 4· ²62 33 342
33 Roby, 2232. ,

l. 16. quotiens . . . dicerent3 subjunct. of cases often occurring: cp.
Introd. p. 16, ξ 34.

l. 18. e. 35. res prolatas, the regular expression for the vacation,
during which senate and law courts were adjourned. The question was
whether this was to be arranged to suit the convenience of Caesar, who
had professed an intention to be absent at a time when important Italian
and provincial business was to have been transacted. On Cn. Piso, cp.
1. 12, 3, etc.

pretium: cp. 1. 57, 4.

l. 21. agendas, sc. ‘ reS,' i. e. ‘ non proferendas?

l. 22. equites. These formed so large a majority of the judicial
‘decuriae,' as to be often synonymous with ‘iudices ' (cp. 3. 3ο, 2, etc.).

1. 23. speeiem libertatis . . . praeceperat, ‘had forestalled him
in a show of independence,’ the newest form of flattery (1. 8, 5). For
‘ praecipere,' cp. 1. 55, 1, etc.

l. 25. conventum, etc„ ‘the concourse of Italians and influx of the
provinces: i. e. those brought to Rome by law-suits, etc.
