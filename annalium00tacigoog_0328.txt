5 11. The date of his ovation is given in an inscription as May 28.

1. 12. Vipsania: see on 1. 12, 6. Agrippa had also children by his
second wife, Marcella (see 2. 51, 2), but their fate is not known. His
children by Julia (Introd. p. 32) are here referred to. On the suspicion

in A. D. 23 (6. 25, 1); Julia also in exile, though not, as far as we know,
by actual violence (4. 71, 6).

1. 16. 2. 20. priore aestate. These words are an error, and perhaps
an interpolation ; the former campaign being given in A. D. 17 (2, 52).

L 22. flagitii3 such a genitive may be treated as akin to that of ’

quality, or partitive, like ‘ morum ‘ (1. 8ο, 2) : cp. ‘ consilii quam formi-
dinis arbitrantur,’ G. 6, 6.

1. 23. pro castris: cp. 2. 8ο, 5.-

1. 25. desertoribus. Tacfarinas himself is described (2. 52, 2) as a
deserter from the Roman service. His troops had undergone some dis-
cipline (1.1.), Β111 are ‘inconditi ’ as compared with RomanS.

1. 26. exceptat, a probable correction for ‘ excepta ' (sc. ‘ sunt’),
which Halm retainS. Tacitus is apt to prefer frequentative to simple
verbs, and may here have followed Silius, who has (9. 367) ‘ per pectora
saevas Ι exceptat mortes?

1. 28. suis, best taken as dat. (Introd. p. 10, ξ 8).

1. 29. 2. 21. 1.. Apronio, formerly a legatus in Germany (1. 56, 1 3
72, 1).

discipline. ff

decumum quemque, etc. This mode of selection is called ‘ deci·
matio‚’ and the punishmfflt itself ‘ fustuarium? It was a kind of running
the gauntlet; the punishment being inflicted by the comradeS, at a
signal from the tribune.

1. 33. vexillum veteranorum: see on 1. 17, 4.

P. 139, 1. 2. Thala, not the city of that name mentioned in Sall. Jug.
75. 1, which must have lain further south.

l. 4. torquibus et hasta. These were usual ⁸ dona militaria ⁹ (1. 44,
7) for distinguished service: cp. Juv. 16. 60, and Mayor ad loc.

1. 5. civ-icam coronam, the crown of oakleaves, the distinctive reward
for saving a citizen in battle. With it considerable privileges were
conferred (see Dict. of Ant.). An inscription shows that Helvius
assumed from it the cognomen ‘ Civica.’

1. 6. questus, 1. 2. affecting to complain, but really well pleased. The
proconsul was not formally a legatus3 but the supreme command of

Caesar extended to all soldierS, wherever stationed.
