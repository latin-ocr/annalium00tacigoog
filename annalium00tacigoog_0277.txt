No ΤΕΞ. BooK Il. CflAPS. 6-10. 26 3

1. 4. limitibus aggeribusque: for the former, see note on 1. 50, 2 ς
for the latter, on 1. 62, 2.

1. 6. e. 8. distributis in: cp. 1. 55, 2; c. 67, 43 3. 38, 4, etc.

Drusianae. Drusus had connected the old Rhine with the Yssel,
and widened the latter river to its mouth ; and was the first Roman (in
Β. e. 12) to sail on the northern ocean.

1. 9. lacus inde, etc. The route is the same as that taken by a part
of the army in the preceding year (1. 60, 3), through the canals and lake
F levo to the mouth of the Ems.

1. 10. elassis, etc. Probably ‘ore' has dropped out before ‘ relicta?
and a conjunction has been lost coupling ‘transposuit ’ and ‘ subvexit‚’
or one or the other of those verbs may be an interpolation. The sen-
tence, as here read, would mean that Germanicus should either have
sailed up the river to a point at which little or no bridging would have
been required, or should have landed his troops at once on the right

1. 14. aestuaria, ‘tidal marshes’ (4. 73, 2, etc.). By ⁸ prima,’ those
nearest to the channel (i. e. the first ground that had to be crossed)
appear to be meant.

1. 17. Ampsivariorum. The MS. has ‘angrioriorum’ (‘Angriva·
riorum ‘); but this people appear (0. 19, 3) to have lived beyond the
Weser. The Ampsivarii are mentioned (13. 5 5, 1) as having been in
alliance with Rome before and at this date, and as bordering on the
Chauci (on whom, see 1. 38, 1). The same correction has been made in
0. 22 33 24, 5.

1. 2ο. ο. 9. visurgis. All mention of the march from the Ems to the
Weser has been omitted or lost; nor can the point at which he touched
the latter river be made out. It is supposed to be in the low ground
north of Minden. The construction with ‘interfluebat' is chiefly poetical,
but found in Livy. ‘ Interluo ' has a similar construction in 6. 1, 1. ¹

1. 2 3. cognomento Flavus. This was evidently his Roman name,
and apparently taken from the colour of his hair. If he was a Roman
citizen, he had also probably the name of Julius (cp. 3. 40, 1).

1. 25. permissu. Some such words as ‘ Caesaris deducitur ' may be
supposed to have dropped out.

1. ²7· pro ripa, ‘ on the bank ε’ cp. the use of ⁶ pro ’ in 0. 13, 4, etc.

1. 30. militaria dona: cp. 1. 44, 7, etc.

1. 31. vilia, i. e. from the view of Arminius himself, ‘ the low wages
he had earned by bondage.’

1. 32. 0. 10. diversi, ‘in opposite strains ε’ cp. 0. 74, 6.

hic, sc. ‘referens,' supplied from ‘ ordiuntur.'

P. 91,1. 1. coniugem et filium: see 1. 57, 53 58, 9. They were

probably in ‘ libera custodia ’ at Ravenna.
