NOTES. BOOK [Π. CHAPS. 34-38. 325

l. 32. ultro metuebantur, not only had themselves nothing to sear,
but even caused fear, by threatening those who would touch them.

P. 147, l. 3. subsidio, ‘refuge’ as in c. 60, 2.

1.4. versas= ‘leversas asin2. 42, 4,etc.

l. 5. damnavisset, ‘had caused to be condemned? In many such
expressions (cp. c. 23, 23 4. 20, 3; 42, 3, 66, 1), persons are said to do
what they cause or recommend to be done.

1. 6. ius experiri, to prosecute her for this fresh offence.

1. 9. attineri: cp. 1. 35, 5, etc. The common prison (‘pnblica cus-
todia’) was under charge of the consuls (c. 22, 5).

1. 14. 0. 37. utrumque, both the punishment of Annia Rufina (c. 36, 4)
and the missive from his father (supposed to have been procured by his
influence) against these persons». Tiberius was still absent from Rome
(see c. 31, 2).

ab eo: such a verb as ‘ existimabant ⁹ is supplied from ‘trahe-
batur,' as again below from ‘ neque . . . displicebat?

l. 15. secreta, ‘the solitary thoughts ;' so ‘secreto suo satiatus ’ (of
Domitian), Agr. 39. 3.

1. 16. huc potius intenderet, “he had better give his mind to this '
(cp. 2. 6, 1).

1. 1 7. aedificationibus. Drusus may have had a passion for building
such mansione as were a leading extravagance of the age (cp. c. 53, 5;
Hor. Od. 3. 1, 33-37, etc.), and may have spent his days in planning
them. Other accounts mention no such propensity, and describe him
as addicted to plays and shows (cp. 1. 76, 5); so that the text may
perhaps be wrong.

1. 19. malas, ‘pemicious;' illustrated by ‘non enim,’ etc„ following.

l. 20. 0. 38. fatiscebant, ‘were becoming exhausted ;’ a metaphorical ’
sense apparently derived from the literal meaning found in Verg. G. 1.

et, giving-an instance, as in 2. 50, 1.

l. 21. postulaverat. The result of this prosecution is given in c.
70, 1. This verb is elsewhere used by Tacitus with genit. (1. 74, 1, etc.),

1. 23. complementum. ‘ the makeweight.' Several instances are
given in which this charge is added to others (2. 50, 13 c. 22, 23
67, 3, etc.).

1. 27. [fratr-eL probably a blundering interpolation; as Tacitus would
hardly have sorgotten that Cotys was described as the nephew of Rhes-
cuporis (2. 64, 3).

volverat, ‘ had contemplated :‘ cp. ⁸ volvens‚’ 1. 64, 7, etc.

1. 28. aqua et igni interdictum: see c. 23, 2, and note there.
