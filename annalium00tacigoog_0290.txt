transparent lightneSS, the‘ Coae’ of Augustan poetS, were worn by rm-
modest women, and, even after this decree, by effeminate men (see 3.

l. 8. excessit, ‘went further-⁹ probably ‘’ceteros is to be supplied,

as in c. 24, 1.
postulavit modum, ⁸ demanded that limit be set?

l. 9. familiae, ‘establishment of slaves? The enormous number of
domestic slaves at Rome is often mentioned ι see 3. 53, 5 ; 4. 27, 2.

l. 10. e re publiea, ‘for the public good:’ so in 3. 53, 1, etc„ and
often in Cic. '

loco sententiae, ‘ when their turn to speak came.’ Fronto’s sug-
gestion‘ was no more than a considerable extension of the proposed
decree; but the privilege extended to the introduction of wholly irrele-
vant matters (cp. c. 37, 3; 38, 33 3. 33, ις 4. 74, 3). Α famous instance
is that of Cato, who constantly added, after speaking to* the question,
‘ceterum censeo delendam esse Karthaginem. ’ See also the 7th Philippic
of CicerO.

1. 13. Fabricios, pl. for sing: cp. 1. 10, 3, etc.

l.14. pecuniam,‘wealt11'‚’ as in 3. 72, 3, etc. What would have
been called affluence m the days of Fabricius would be poverty in those
of the ScipioS.

referri = ἀναφέρεσθαι, ‘are relative to.'

l. 16. gliscere, ⁴ advanced, ·’ hardly used elsewhere of persons except
in lthe sense of' increase in number (4. 5, 5· 27, 3).

l. 18. ex, ‘in relation to.’ cp. ‘ex. .utilitatibus,’ 1. 58, 2, etc.

distinctos, sc. ‘a censu plebis :⁹ so below, with ⁸ diversi natura,'
‘ senatores equitesque a plebe ’ must be supplied, and these two orders
taken as the subject of ‘antistent.' On the senatorial census, see 1. 75,
5 ; on the equestrian‚ 4. 63, 2.

l. 19. sed ut qui, etc. The supposition of Nipperdey that, owing
to the proximity of ‘quia,' ‘ qui’ may have been lost, is here adopted. ⁶
‘Antistent’ is to be again supplied with ‘loeis,’ etc„ and these words,
as also ‘aliis,’ are to be taken as ablatives of respect. ⁶ With Halm’s
reading, ‘antistare’ is to be supplied, from ‘antistent‚’ with ‘ita iis!
Either text would give the meaning that, in prescribing a high pro·
perty qualification for senators and knights», it was intended that those
who were preeminent in political position should be so also in their means
of enjoying life. ‘ Locis’ refers to their place in the theatre, ‘ ordinibus ’
to their position as orders of aristocracy, ‘dignationibus ’ to personal
