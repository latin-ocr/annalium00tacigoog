ΟΝ ΤΗΕ SYNTAX AND STYLE OF TACITUS. ·

N orm—Most of what is here said is applicable to the writings of
Tacitus as a whole, and especially to the Annals; but the instances
given are almost wholly from the four Books contained in this
volume. The references in square brackets are to the sections of
the larger edition; those to which ‘ R,’ is prefixed are to the sec-
tions of Roby’s Grammar.

ΒΥ the time of TacituS, Latin prose composition had already
departed much from the standard of Cicero or Caesar, through
the frequent adoption of words and forms of expression from the
great classic poets‚ who had by that time become text-books in
every grammar-school ; also through an increasing tolerance of
Greek words and grammatical GraecismS‚ partly due to such
study of Augustan poetry, partly to an increasing taste for what
was Greek as such ¹.

The special qualities of the style of Tacitus have been held to
consist chiefly in rhetorical or poetical colouring, in the study of
brevity‚ and in that of variety ; all of which characteristics are
no doubt due mainly to his professional career ². He has him-
self told us that the pleader in his day could no longer expatiate

· like Cicer0, but was bound to be terse, epigrammatic, and

striking, and to grace his style with poetic colouring from the
treasury of Vergil and Horace, or even from more recent poets ³.

. In falling in with this fashion, Tacitus draws the poetic element

in his style almost exclusively from Vergil, to whom he is re-
peatedly and abundantly indebted; while his chief prose models
are Sallust and Livy, his great predecessors in the field of
history ⁴. The effort at variety of expression, besides being part
of the habitual skill osan orator, is further due to the historian’s
desire to relieve what he feels to be the oppressive monotony of
his subject ⁵, by saying the same thing with the utmost variety of

¹ Juvenal mentions (7, 226) the use of Horace and Vergil as school-
bookS, and also dwells at length (3, 61 foll.) on the extent to which the
Rome of his day had become Greek. ² See above, p. 1.
