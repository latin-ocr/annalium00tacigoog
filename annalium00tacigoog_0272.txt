end of his life; but other governors of Moesia are mentioned (see 2. 66,
33 3· 39. 1³ 4·47‚ 1)-

1. 12. morum, partitive genit.: the sing. ⁴ moris est ⁸ is frequently so
used by2Cicer0, etc.

causae, etc. He is himself said to have told a story of the mis-
taken kindness of those who drove away the gorged flies from a wounded'
