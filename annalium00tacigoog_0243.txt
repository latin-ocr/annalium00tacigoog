NOTES. BOOK I. CHAPS. 23-28. 229

l. 3. augendis . . . stipendiis, etc.. dat. of purpose, cp. Introd.
. 1 1, ξ 1 1.
P 1. 5. eunetis, an exaggeration. Every centurion could use his vine·
' rod (c. 23, 4), but only their commander, the ‘legatus Augusti,’ could
put soldiers to death.

1. 7. rettulisse, ‘had repeated:’ so 4. 4, 3; cp. ‘ nota refert mere-
tricis acumina‚' Hor. Epp. 1. 17, 55.

1. 8. filios-familiarum. By Roman law, the son was not ‘ sui iuris ’
while his father lived. Tiberius had been thus under the ‘ postestas ' of
Augustus; Drusus was under that of Tiberius.

quod imperator, etc. Stress is laid on ‘ commoda; ’ ‘ impera-
tor ' being also emphatic in relation to ‘ militis! They would say that
the ‘ emperor,’ who has full power over soldiers (see Introd. p. 24), only
refers to the senate when it is a question of rewarding them.

l. 11. sub dominis, ‘ under despotism ' (see 2. 87, 2, and note there),
here invidiously contrasted with ‘ siue arbitro ’ (‘ without control of any
kind ’).

l. 13. e. 27. ut quis . . . occurreret, ‘whenever any . . . met them? On
the form ‘ut quis,' see Introd. p. 10, 5 3 ; on the subjunct„ Id. p. 16, ᾗ 34.

1. 15. oausam discordiae, etc„ in apposition, not with ‘ manus: but
with the idea denoted by the sentence (see Introd. p. 11, ξ 5).

1. 16. gloria belli. His military successes are mentioned in the
notice of his death (4. 44, 1).

l. 1 7. militiae flagitia, ‘ military outrages? ‘ Flagitium ' is used
generally of mutinous conduct 111 c. 43, 23 here it might possibly=
‘ flagitationes? and refer to their extravagant demands.

l. 18. oum Caesare. It is probably not meant that Drusus was also
intending to depart‚ but that he was escorting Lentulus so as to see him
safely out of the camp. It is implied in ‘ repetentem ’ that the winter
camp had been previously occupied by the force sent from Rome, and
in its being chosen as a refuge, that some of these troops still occu·
pied it.

provisu, a word peculiar to Tacitus and only used in the abl„
ostener in the sense of ‘ forethought ’ than ‘ foresight 3 ’ but cp. ‘ provi·
debat,’ 4. 41, 3.

1. 22. multitudinis, ‘ the main body,’ explained by the following
words to be not that of the legions, but the force from Rome. If they
were quartered in the winter camp (see above) we must suppose it to
have been near, and that they had advanoed from it to a gate of the
summer camp, at which this assault and' rescue took place.

1. 25. e. 28. languescere. It is evident that an eclipse is meant,

though this verb is nowhere else used in such a sense. The date is fixed
by astronomical calculation to Sept. 26.
