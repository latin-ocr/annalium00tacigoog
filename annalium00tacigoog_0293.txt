*⁸1 Ι

NOTES. BOOK η. CHAPS. 35-39· 279

1. 26. satis habebam, si, ‘ used to hold it sufficient that z ' so in 4.
38, 1. The tenses of ‘potuissem ’ and ‘ habebam ’ refer to the time be-
fore his marriage, and the former is a causal subjunct.

1. 28. stirps et progenies, apparently imitated from ‘stirps haec
progeniesque mea est’ (Ov. Trist. 3. 14, 4), where ‘ stirPS,' in the sense
of the ‘seion‚' is synonymous with ‘ progenies!

1. 29. ad invidiam, sc. ‘ spectans,‘ ‘for the purpose of reproach ς’
van'ed in the next clause to the gerundive dative (Introd. p. 11, 5 1 1).

1. 33. c. 38. Inclinatio, etc. The stress appears to be on ⁴ promp-
tius? Tiberius had made up his mind, and, seeing the sympathy of the
senate, spoke at once before it had gone too far.

P. 104, 1. 3. res publiea, ‘the funds of the treasury.’

l. 4. egredi . . . relationem, etc.: see c. 33, 2.

1. 6. augeamus, taken by zeugma with ‘negotia 3’ ‘ push our own
business and increase our means.’

l. 8. non enim preces sunt istud, ‘for this is not a case of en-
treaty : ’ cp. ⁸ non medicinam illud ’ (1. 49. 4), etc. In older writers the
pronoun would usually be attracted.

1. 11. modestiam, the delicacy which they might feel towards a
brother senator.

1. 12. ambitione, ‘by favouritism ε’ cp. 1. 67, 4, etc.

1. 14. ea'lege ut, ‘ with the understanding that.’

l. 15. alioqui, ‘otherwise,’ i.e. if such requests were generally
granted.

intendetur, ⁸ will be aggravated! This sense of the word (c. 57,
3; 4. 11, 4 ; 26, 2; 40, 4, etc.) is almost wholly Tacitean.

1. 16. ex se. The subject of reference is implied in the context, and
⁶ metus’ answers to ‘socordiass as ‘ spes ' to ⁸ industria.’

l. 23. ducena sestertia. As there were four sons (c. 37, 3), this ‘
gift amounts to four-fifths of that of Augustus.

l. 25. retinens, with genit.: cp. Introd. p. 13, ὅ 21 b. For the co-
ordination of causal abl. and participle, cp. Id. p. 21, 5 54 f.

1. 31. ο. 39. in insulam Planasiam. On the banishment of Agrippa
to this place, and his death there, see 1. 3, 43 5, 2 ; 6, 1, foll.

1. 33. ausa. This subst. appears first in Verg. (Aen. 2. 535, etc.).

P. 105, 1. 1. praecipitia, used of desperate or dangerous courses in
15. 29, 1, ‘omissis praecipitibus tuta. capessentem‘

l. 2. furatur cineres. This would destroy the chief ev idence of
Agrippa's death.

1. 3. crinem barbamque promitteret, so as to imitate the unkempt
state of Agrippa in his banishment.

1. 4. dissimili in. The prep. has the force of πρός, and the expres-
sion is nearly equivalent to a simple dative (see on 1. 76, 5).
