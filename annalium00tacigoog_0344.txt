330 TA CITUS .· ANNALs.

1. 2 5. Dolabella Cornelius, afterwards proconsul of Africa (4. 23, 2).
Other base acts are recorded of him in c. 69, 1 ; 4. 66, 2.

1. 29. ferocissimas gentes, alluding to his wars against the Germane,
and his suppression of the Illyrian revolt. See 1. 4, 3 ; 2. 26, 3, etc.

l. 30. tot . . . triumphos. He appears to have three times received
triumphal distinctions of one kind or another; but his flatterer Velleius
says that he might have claimed seven.

1. 32. c. 48. Sulpicii Quirini: see c. 22, 1; 2. 30, 4.-

publicis exsequiis, ‘a funeral at the public eost?

1. 33. frequentaretur, ‘should be celebrated! Tacitus has thus
‘celebrare mortem ’ (6. 27, 2).

P. 152, l. 4. Homonadensium, a Cilician people living in Pisidia or
Isauria. Tacitus may have thought that they were spread over parts of
Cilicia itself.

insignia triumphi: see on 1. 72, 1.

1. 5. datusque rector, etc. This appointment dates probably from
the death of Lollius (A.D. 2). Gaius Caesar (see on 1. 3, 3 ; 2. 2, 2: 4²·
3, etc.) was then in military possession of Armenia.

'I'iberium quoque. The return of Tiberius from Rhodes (see on
1. 4, 4) belongs to the same year as the death of Lollius; the passage
has therefore been stopped so as to imply that the attention paid to him
by Quirinius may have been at an earlier date, probably when the latter
appears to have been proconsul of Asia (13.0. 7-3).

1. 7. M. Lollio. This person is praised highly by Horace (Od. 4. 9,
34-44)‚ but is painted in the blackest colours by Velleius and Pliny.
On his defeat in Germany, see 1. 10, 3.

1. 8. pravitatis et discordiarum, ‘ perverseness and enmity’ (towards
Tiberius himself), or perhaps, as a hendiadys, ‘ perverse enmity.'

1. 9. ut memoravi, c. 22, 3. His childlessness, there mentioned,
would explain the great influence here ascribed to him (see c.· 25, 2).

1. 14. c. 49. corripuit: cp. 2. 28, 4.

1. 15. maiore praemio vulgaretur, ‘might be published and more
liberally rewarded.’ As having speculated on the death of Drusus, he
was presumed to have desired it: the offence being somewhat similar to
that of consulting astrologers ‘in domum Caesaris ’ (c. 22. 2, etc.).

1. 18. legerat. The difficulty of supposing that one of.the persons
present could have denied having heard what had been formally recited
gives some ground to a correction, ‘ iecerat’ (cp. c. 66, 2); which would
imply no more than that he had talked of it, and perhaps quoted bits
of it.

l. 20. arguentibus ad perniciem, ‘witnesses supporting the charge

to his destruction.’
Haterii Assrixmae τ see on 1. 77, 3. As consul-designate, he gave
