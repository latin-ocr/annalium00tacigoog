P. 97, 1. 2. c. 24. praestat . . . excessit. That which is exceeded is to
be supplied from the sense. So ‘ excessit,' c. 33, 2 ; ‘ praestitisset,’ c. 73, 4.

1. 3. ita vasto et profundo. ‘Mari ’ is to be supplied from ‘mare'
below, and both this clause and ‘hostilibus . . . litoris ' are to be taken
as abl. aba, like ‘periculoso ' (1. 6, 6), etc.

l. 4. novissimum ac sine terris, ‘ the boundary of the world, and
with no lands beyond it:

1. 5. insulas longius sitas. These are distinct from those men-
tioned in c. 23, 3, and may be those off the west coast of Schleswig.

1. 7. elisa, ‘ cast on shore ;’ apparently a new sense of the word.

toleraverant, ‘ had maintained‚’ up to the time of their discovery.

1. 8. adpulit: cp. c. 6, 2 ; with accus. in c. 54, 3, etc.

1. 9. scopulos. The rocks on this coast are imaginary (cp. c. 23, 3).

l. 1 1. secundante. This verb is poetical, and elsewhere takes an accus,

l. 1 2. intentis vestibus. Similar contrivances are described in
Juv. 12. 67.

l. 15. Ampsivarii. See c. 8, 4 (and note), and c. 22, 3. It is im-
plied that they lived near the coast, and that some other coastmen had
sold their prisoners inland. It is to be noted that the British princes are
here implied to have been on friendly terms with Rome.

1. 18. ambiguas, ‘intermediate between ;‘ so used in c. 40, 13 oftener
with a single genit. as in 1. 7, 4, etc. It is possible that seals may have
passed for mermen. Tacitus himself appears to disbelieve these tales.

1. 22. c. 25. ire . . . imperat. The simple inf. with this verb (cp.
Introd. p. 14, ζ 27) is found in poets and Sallust. Silius had already
attacked the Chatti in this year (c. 7, 1); the Marsi had been invaded
two years previously (1. 50, 6, solt).

1. 25. aquilam. With the three legions of VaruS, three eagles had been
lost. One had been already recovered (1. 60, 4); the third was regained
in the first year of Claudius.

1. 27. terga circumgressi: cp. 4. 73, 2 ; also with accus. in Sallust.

recluderent3 so ‘tellus . . . recluditur,’ Verg. G. 2. 42 3. The
verb is poetical, and rare in any other prose author.

1. 29. excindit, in this sense, apparently taken from Vergil (see
Introd. p. 22, ξ 58, 4).

restiterat, ⁴ had made a stand τ’ cp. 1. 61, 3.
1². 98, l. 3. c. 26. animi. On this case, cp. Introd. p. 13, ξ 21 c.
1. 7. αᾱὶοοιῖἷῗιῗτῗῗο. ‘ bello ’=‘ adsumeretur.'
1. 8. bellum patrari: cp. 3. 47, 1 3 an expression used by Sallust
and old writers of bringing a war to a close.
l. 9. triumphum: see 1. 55, 1.
eventuum, used specially of successes in Agr. 8, 2; 22ς 3, 27, 2,
etc.,; hence here explained by ‘prospera . . . proelia,’ as ⁶ casuum' by
‘quae venti . . . intulissent!
