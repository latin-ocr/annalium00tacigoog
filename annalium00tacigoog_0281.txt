NOTES. BOOK II. CHAPS. 14—17. 267

as ‘ memini ' to a present. The avarice, etc. are the characteristics of
Roman rule as they had known it under Varus.

l. 21. aliud sibi reliquum. The omission of an interrogative particle
should be noted as very rare in ‘ oratio obliqua?

l. 24. ο. 16. IdisiavisO. The name is connected with an old German
word ‘ Idis' (‘Nympha’), and explained to mean ‘Nympharum pratum.'
The case is probably nom„ in accordance with the general usage of
Tacitus in such phrase5‚ in respect of substantives: see Introd. p.
ιο, ε 7·

1. 25. ut ripae, etc. This is an antithesis between ‘ripae fluminis'
and ‘ prominentia montium‚’ also between ‘ cedunt' and ‘resistunt.’ The
meaning appears to be that the plain winds along the river-side in unequal
width‚ being broad where the river recedes (bends westward) from the
mountains, and narrow where the mountain spurs resist it (i. e. where
the river would take a turn to the east and is stopped by them).

1. 26. tergum, sc. ‘Germanorum’ The locality is supposed to be
somewhat above Minden‚ and the German position to have faced north,
with its left near the river, which, owing to a great bend here in its
course, would be also in the rear of the fugitives (c. 17, 8).

l. 27. pura, ‘ free from brushwood :' cp. ‘ puro . . . camp0,’Verg. Aen.
12. 771.

1. 28. campum, etc. Their main body extended from west to east,
partly on the plain, partly within the outskirts of the wood behind them.
The heights occupied by the Cheruscans were on the east, or right
wmg.

l. 29. proeliantibus, probably abl. abs„ as ‘incurr0‚' usually takes
the accus, in Tacitus (c. 17, 1; 1. 51, 6, etc.),

l. 32. praetoriis cohortibus. Two of these had attended Drusus
to Illyricum (1. 24, 1) ; so that two others may probably have gone out
with Germanicus to Germany. They are mentioned again in c. 20, 6.

P. 94, l. 2. adsisteret. The verb is used of taking up a position
(c. 17, 4; 19, 4, etc.), and is here brachylogically equivalent to ‘consis-
teret et se explicaret ε’ ‘ that the order of march might deploy into line
of battle ;’ i. e. that each should stand next in line to those to whom
they had been next in column.

l. 6. c. 17. augurium, used, like ‘auspiciis' (c. 14, 2) of the omen.
The verb is adapted to the noun in apposition, as in 3. 21, 2, etc.

1. 7. advertere: cp. 1. 41, 1.

1. 8. legionum numina: see on 1. 39, 7.

l. 10. impulit, ‘drove from their positionz' cp. ‘fimpulsae,' 1. 63, 3.

duo hostium agmina, etc. The attack of Stertinius in the rear
may be supposed to have driven the German left out into the plain, the
advance of infantry in front to have driven their centre into the wood,
