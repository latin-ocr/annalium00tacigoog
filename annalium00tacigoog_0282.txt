and the flank attack (5 1) to have dislodged the Cheruseans, who would
thus be forced into the space between the two routed masses.

1. 12. campis, a free use of the local abl. (Introd. p. 11, 5 14) ; the
simple abl. after ‘detrudere ' is found in Vergil (Aen. 7. 469).

l. 14. manu voce vulnere. The asyndeta appear to form a climax
(Introd. p. 17, 5 41), as in 4. 46, 5 ; 49, 4, ete.; so that ‘manu' would
probably mean mere gesture, and ‘vulnere,‘ ‘by displaying his wound'
(and, as it were, demanding the same sacrifice from his men). The abla-
tives are best taken as depending on ‘sustentabat’

incubuerat, ⁴ he had thrown himself (directed the force of his
attack) upon.'

1. 15. illa, sc. ‘partez’ on the concise use of ‘rupturus,’ see Introd.
p. 16, 5 35. The simple verb is very rarely, but ‘ perrumpere’ often
used intransitively.

1. 17. pervasit, i. e. he got through by himself: the attempt to break

. through in a body failed.

l. 18. Chaucis: see 1. 38, 13 60, 3.

1. 19. Inguiomero: see 1. 60, 1.

l. 22. operuere, used by zeugma with ‘tela' and ⁸ vis fluminis)

l. 23. nisi. The sense of ‘climbing‘ is chiefly poetical: cp. Verg. G.
2. 4283 Aen. 2. 443.

S 1. 24· adflixere, ‘dashed to the ground: ’ so ‘equi atque viri adflicti?
all. Jug. 101, 11.

l. 28. o. ζῆ, repertis . . . eatenis, etc. A similar, story is told by
Polybius of the expedition of Flaminius against Hannibal.

1. 29. in Romanos, perhaps nearly equivalent to a dative: cp. 1.
76, 5-

1. 30. Tiberium imperatorem salutavit. By ancient custom, the
army would thus salute its general (see 3. 74, 6); and now the chief
command and ‘ auspicia' of all the armies was regarded as inherent in
the ‘proconsulare imperium' of the ‘princeps' (cp. Introd. p. 24, and
references there). Augustus received the ‘nomen imperatoris’ twenty-one
times (1. 9, 2), Tiberius eight times3 many of the occasions being those
of such vicarious victorieS.

1. 31. in modum tropaeorum. The usual form of a trophy is
described byVergil (Aen. 11. 5—11). Another is described below (c. 22,
1). The word and the thing are Greek, and common in Thucydidae, etc.

Ρ. 95, 1. 1. m ea speeies, ‘that spectaclet' cp. 3. 60, 6, etc.

abire sedibust cp. Introd. p. 1 1, 5 13, and ⁴ abire Suria,' c. 69, 3.
The simple abl. is classical in such phrases* as ‘abire magistratu: etc.

1. 3. plebes primores. etc. For such antithetical asyndeta‚ cp. 1.
