exemptions from task-work or furloughs, and extra tasks were osten put
on to force them into doing ἑο.

L 5. redimi, ‘ was bought off.’ From this the sense of the simple

1. 6. exercitas, ‘spent in toil:' so ‘ exercita militia‚’ c. 35, 2.

l. 8. singulos denarios. This would be considerably more than the
ten ‘ asses ’ mentioned above; since, by the lowering of the copper
standard in the Hannibalic war, the ‘as ’ had come to be only ᾗ of
the ‘ denarius. ’

l. 10. isdem in castris, i. e. at the time and place of discharge.

pecunia, in cash, instead of assignations of worthless land (see
above, ξ 5).

1.13. non obtrectari, etc„ ironically,‘ we do not speak disrespect·
fully of a sentinel’ s watch ιιι Rome; but our quarters are among savage
races, with the enemy in sight! On the dat. ‘sibi’ see Introd. p. 10, ξ 8.

l. 19. c. 18. agitaverint: cp. c. 5, 1. The verb takes an inf. in 2.4‚
53 82, 3·

1. 2ο. eum honorem, i. e. to give its name to this ‘ una legio.'

1. 21. aquilas, etc. Each legion bad one eagle, under the custody of
its chief centurion (⁸ centurio primopilus ’). This passage would show
that each of its ten cohorts had a ‘signum z ' also each of its thirty
maniples had a ‘vexillum’ (see c. 34, 4).

l. 22. sedes, the spot where the eagles, etc. were collected.

1. 23. properantibus might possibly be a dat. like ¹ pectori adcre-
verat ’ (c. 19, 1), or a concise abl. abs. (see Introd. p. 12, ξ 19 b).

l. 28. c. 19. pectori adcreverat. Such a dat. is found with ‘ad-

L 6. ab sedecim, ‘after sixteen years! Cp. c. 26, 23 ‘ab hac con-
tione: Liv. 24. 22, 6.

1. 7. provenissent, ‘had succeeded.' cp. 4.12‚ 3. This sense of
the word is almost peculiar to Tacitus.

1. 8. filius. worator ‘the fact that the general’ s son was spokes·
man? This concise construction (cp ‘Agrippina.. .commotior} c. 33,
6) resembles that of participles (Introd. p. 16, ς 36).
