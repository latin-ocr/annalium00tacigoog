NOYES. BOOK II. CHAPS.58-61. 291

1. 5. c. 60. Canope, near Abukir.

1. 7. diversum: cp. 1. 17, 5. The tradition of Menelaus in Egypt is
Homeric (Od. 4. 350, etc.); but that of his pilot CanopuS, resembling
that of Palinurus in Italy (Verg. Aen. 6. 381), appears to be of late
date.

1. 8. inde, sc. ‘ visit: supplied from below.

1. 9. Herculi. The Egyptian Hercules appears to be a form of the
sun-god.

1. 10. antiquissimum, · the oldest of the name!

eosque, etc„ ⁸ and that those who (elsewhere) resembled him in
prowess were called after him.' Many deities in different nations were
identified by the Greeks with their Heracles‚ and by the Romans with
Hercules (on whom see Mommsen, Hist. 1. p. 174).

1. 1 2. structis molibus, ‘on piles of masonry, ’those of Karnak
« and Luxor. By ‘litterae‚' the hieroglyphice are meant.

⁴ Aethiopia’ denotes especially Nubia and Abyssinia. The conquest of
· those countries, as also of Syria and Mesopotamia, by Rameses, is con-
firmed by monuments; the rest are not. The variation in the forms of
expression, to avoid monotony in so long a list, is worthy of note.

1. 19. Bithynum . . . Lycium mare. The former denotes the Eu·
xine and Propontis, the latter the northern part of the Levant 3 so that
the terms taken together include the whole of Asia Minor.

1. 26. c. 61. Memnonis saxea effigies, etc. A sound resembling
that of a broken harpstring was heard at daybreak from the remains of
a shattered statue in the ruins of Thebes. This is attested¹ by many
inscriptions on the statue itself, and may have arisen from the effect of a
sudden increase of heat on the chilled air in its creviees, On the restora-
tion of the statue, and consequent alteration of its structure, the sounds
ceased. See Professor Mayor on Juv. 15. 5.

ᾗ l. 27. disiectas, ‘drifted.’ The general idea of the verb is that of
dispersion (1. 32, 73 61, 3 ς c. 23, 3), which may cause accumulation
in some placeS.
