or thoughtless word into a charge of treason ι; he must devolve
on the senate the odious duty of trial and condemnation ², and
reserve only the credit of clemency for himself ³.

We are to suppose this suppression of all outward sign of the
tyrant to be gradually relaxed 4; the deaths of Germanicus and
Drusus 'threw him more unreservedly into the power of his
minister⁵; the death of his mother freed him from a life-long
habit of submission ; even the fall of Seianus was the removal
of a restraint, whereby the propensities to abominable profligacy
and savage cruelty‚ the one finding full scope in seclusion, the
other aggravated by isolation and fear, revealed themselves as
the true character so long concealed.

The portrait of §gianus has come down to us imperfect, but
the steps of his rise at least are clearly indicated. We see him
succeeding to the ‘ praefectura praetorii' as an unimportant
office ⁶, and making it the most powerful position in the State ;
playing skilfully upon his master’s weaknesses by representing
the advantage of concentrating the praetorian guard in a barrack
close outside the waIIS, and then securing to himself the assured
support of this formidable force ⁷. Drusus is got rid of by
poison ⁸3 the family of Germanicus undermined by a series of
insidious attacks⁹; the single false step of too bold a request
for the hand of Livia promptly retrieved ¹⁰, and his position soon
after more than restored by a lucky accident ¹¹ ; by a stroke of
consummate tact‚ the prince’s sense of failing power, the desire
to escape from the eyes of men, and other such motives, are
adroitly made use of to withdraw him to a retreat, which might
pave the way to permanent and complete retirement, and mean-
while concentrate all real power in the hands of his representa·
tive at Rome ¹².
