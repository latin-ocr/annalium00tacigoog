l. 2. fan patriae: cp. ‘fas gentium} 1. 42, 4.
penetralis . . . deos, according to Cic. (N. D. 2. 27, 68) a poetical
expression for ‘ Dii penates ς’ here the ‘home-gods’ of Germany.

1. 10. Romanis in castris: see note on 1. 55, 2.

l. 13. c. 11. dare=‘committere:’ cp. 1. 47, 1.

1. 14. imperatorium, ‘good generalship.' This substantival use and
sense is noted as a novelty.

l. 15. primipilarium, a term formed on the analogy of ‘ consulares?
etc., to express those who had served the office of ‘ centurio primipilus:
which qualified them for higher commands (cp. 4. 72, 2). This Aemi-
lius (probably the same mentioned in 4. 42, 2) was evidently at this
time a ‘ praefectus equitum.'

l. 17. erupit, sc. ‘ ex amne?

L 18. circumiectam, ‘ surrounded by.’ This participle has usually
a dat. of the 'thing surrounded5 but here takes the construction com-
monly found with ‘circumdatusff

1. 22. saevitia, ‘the fury;' so used of enemies, not in a bad sense, in

term is often used of soldiers (e. g. 1. 25, 1 ; 4. 50, 4 ; and in Livy), but
does not appear to denote any definite formation.

1. 24. suffosso equo: cp. 1. 65, 8.

1. 29. c. 12. Herculi, probably identified with the German hero Irmin.

1. 31. suggressi, ‘having approacheds a word almost confined to the
Annals (4. 47, 2, etc..)

to originate in poetry (Verg. G. 1.175, etc..)

secreti et incustoditi, in privacy and off their guard.' For the
former, cp. ‘secretus agitat,’ 11. 21. 2; for the latter, ‘ incustoditum
amorem,' 12. 4, 2.
1. 7. c. 13. augurali. According to Quintilian, this was a name in
his time for the general’s tent. The abl. would thus depend on ⁸ egres-
sus? Others make it synonymous with a space called ‘ auguratorium,’

adjoining the 'general’s quarters, and take the case here to be an abl.
of direction (cp. 1. 60, 2, etc.).
