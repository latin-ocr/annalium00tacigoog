would appear to be invidiously contrasted in the writer's mind

., with Trajan, not only as the patron of delation with its repressor,

. but as the timid and cautious guardian of the frontiers of
Augustus with the, conqueror of Dacia and great part of the
East¹. Many misconceptions and much misinterpretation of
motives may also be traceable to the theory, whereby the fact of
a period of firm and just rule followed by subsequent deteriora-
tion is persistently treated as the gradual unfolding of an in-
herently vicious character, rather than by more just and natural
means of explanation.

I t is easy, again, to show that the facts recorded of Germanicus
fail to support the conception formed of him ; that his victories
are barren ², not unfrequently matred by needless massacre ³,
and entailing manifold losses and disasters to the army under
his command⁴=3 that most of his movements in the East are
those of a mere tour of pleasure⁶ 3 that no administrative mea-
sure betokening statesmanship is recorded of him.

still, when all deduction is made, it is to Tacitu5‚ far more
than to any other writer now preserved to uS, that we owe any
knowledge of the working of the constitution under which Rome
and the Empire then were governed‚ any conception of the per-
sonality of the chief men of the age, any attempt to penetrate the
motives and springs of action, either in ruler or subject: and
even when we move to set aside or modify his judgment on a
character such as that of TiberiuS, it is chiefly from his own
candour and sense of justice in the statement of facts, far more
than from any counter-evidence, that the means of criticising his
insinuations and generalisations have been supplied to uS.
