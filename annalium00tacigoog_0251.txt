l. 32. socer Drusus, i. e. the thought, or image of him: pregnant
construet. as in c. 39, 8. The relationship expressed is throughout that
of Agrippina.

insigni fecunditate. Besides the three sons already born (see
Introd. p. 32), three children had died in infancy.

1. 33. infans. Gaius Caesar (Caligula) was just two years old. In
speaking of him as born in the camp, Tacitus follows a prevalent but,
apparently, erroneous account; his real birthplace being Antium. For
⁸ militari vocabulo,' cp. c. 23, 4.

P. 66, 1. 2. vulgi. Officers above the rank of centurion wore

‘ Μ’ hence the ‘ caliga ’ is so far characteristic of the lower ranks as
to be called ⁴ gregalis habitus ’ (c. 69, 5).
· l. 4. orant obsistunt, etc. The construction is again designedly
abrupt: ‘orant ’ is explained by ‘ rediret maneret 3 ' ‘ obsistunt ⁹ refers
strictly to ‘pars . . . occursantes: and more loosely to ‘ plurimi . . .
regressi!

1. 6. recens, ‘ fresh from,' i. e. with their influence still strong on him:
cp. ‘ recens praetura: 4. 52, 2. The abl. is analogous to that of place

1. 10. c. 42. liberos, rhetorical plural; only one child being present.

1. ι 3. istud sceleris, quasi-partitive genit.: see Introd. p. 13, ξ 2ο.

l. 14. pietur, here used in a peculiar sense (‘ may exhaust itself'):
so Propertius (4. 19, 8) says (of Medea) ‘quo tempore matris Ι iram na-
torum caede piavit amor.’

L 15. inausum intemeratumve. Both words appear first in Vergil.
- 1.16. quod nomen, etc. Tacitus appears in this passage to follow

a speech of similar character given by Livy (28. 27) as that of Scipio
Africanus to his mutinous troops.

1. 18. proiecta, ‘trampled under foot,’ by the inqut offered to the
‘legati’ (ο. 39 6)

hostium quoque iun, ‘rights accorded to enemiesss i. e. ‘laws of

war? This and the two following expressions dwell rhetorically on the
same idea, the conjunctions being epexegetical· . ‘’sacra means ‘sanctity,’
as in 2. 65, 4, ‘fas gentium,⁹ ‘the obligation towards (law of) nations'
(cp. ‘fas patriae, 2. 10, 1).

1.19. divus Iulius, etc. The occasion is generally taken to be that
of the mutiny os the tenth legion near Rome in Β. C. 47. By calling
them‘ Quirites,’ he implied that they were no longer soldiers.

1. 20. divus Augustus, etc. The allusion is supposed to be to a
mutiny at Brundusium in the winter of Rc, 31-300
