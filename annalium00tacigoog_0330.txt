P.14o‚ 1. 2. cuius ea . . ‚visebantur = ‘cuius erant ea . . . quae
visebantur.’ The theatre of Pompeius (cp. c. 72, 4; 4. 7, 3), in the

1. 4. detestanda = ⁸ detestabilia,’ as in 4. 69, 3, etc.

1. 5. obscurissimae domui: see c. 48, 2. Though of low origin,

1. 8. itum, sc. ⁴ pedibus ⁹ (⁴ they divided in favour of’).

Rubelli Blandi· cp.c.51, 1. He afterwards became the husband
of julia, daughter of Drusus.

aqua et igni arcebatur. This sentence of exile, conveyed by
forbidding any to supply the condemned with fire and water within
certain localities, might leave a limited choice of the place of residence‚
or might be accompanied with deportation to a particular island. In

banishment (‘ fuga ').

1. 20. violatae maiestatis: see on 2. 50, 1. ,
l. 21. egrediebatur, with accus.. as in 1. 3ο, 2, etc. His own ‘lex
Iulia de adulteriis ’ (see 2. 50, 2) enaeted less severe penalties than those

which he thus arbitrarily inflicted.

1. 22. sed . . . memorabo. This promise appears never to have been
fulfiued.

l. 23. in quae tetendi, ‘my present object!

curas. The use of this word for litei-ary work (cp. 4. 11, 5)
appears to be taken from Ovid, ex P. 4. 16. 39.
