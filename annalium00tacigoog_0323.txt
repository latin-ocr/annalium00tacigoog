1. 29. cognitionem exciperet, ‘to take up the case.' The power of
the princeps to try offences before his personal court (Introd. p. 24)
existed under Augustus, but was rarely used till the time of Claudius and
Nero, when it became a great engine of tyranny.

1. 31. contra, sc. ‘ratus‚’ supplied from ‘metuens'

1. 32. conscientiae . . . innexum, ‘implicated in the complicity of ’

(cp. 2· 77, 6)-
in deterius: cp. 2. 82, 1, ete.

P. 133,1. 2. quaque . . . fama distraheretur, ‘the reports by which
his character was being torn in pieces.' The verb is so used of a struggle
in the mind, as in 2. 40, 1; 4. 40, 8. The metaphor in ⁸ dominos . . . dif-
ferebant' (1. 4, 3) is perhaps similar.

1. 3. hinc, ‘from the other side :' cp. ‘illic’ 1. 70, 6.

1. 9. iisque . . . excusantibus, an abl. abs. interpolated into the con-
struction, as bringing in another circumstance. Examples are found in
earlier Latin, and more frequently in Greek, as καὶ πάντα διαπραξάμενος
. . . , καὶ ψηφισαμένων Ἀθηναίων . . . , τῶν τε . . . στρατηγῶν ἕνα προσελό-
μενος (Thuc. 4. 29, 1). ‘Excusare‘ here means ‘ to plead in excuse :'
cp. ‘excusare laborem ’ (Hor. Epp. 1. 7, 67), etc.

1. 10. Μ’. Lepidus: see on c. 32, 23 1. 13, 2, etc.

1.. Piso, probably the same mentioned in 2. 34, 1.

1. 11. adi-ecta, ‘excited to see.’ The construction is such as would

follow a verb expressing expectation or wonder.

quanta fides . . . quae fiducia. The ‘ fides ’ spoken of is appa-
rently their fidelity to their solemn promise (2. 71, 8); while ⁴ quae
fiducia ’ means ‘ on what the accused relied :⁹ cp. ‘quae sit fiducia capto ‘
(Verg. Aen. 2. 75).

the use of ⁴ temperamentum ’ in describing the character of Μ’. Lepidus
(4. 20, 4). and its use in the sense of compromise ⁹ (‘eleganti tempera-
mento ') in 11. 4, 7.
