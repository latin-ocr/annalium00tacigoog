these.

1. 5. ut erant, etc„ ‘ his real thought rather than his words!

1. 7. egregium publicum. The analogy of ‘ bonum,’ ‘malum,'
‘optimum,' ⁶ pessimum publicum’ suggests that ⁸ egregium ’ is here the
substantive. The words might be taken to mean ‘ his distinction in the
state,’ as a consular and leading senator, contrasted with the ‘ accom-
plishments os his private life' (cp. 1. 13, 1: 4. 6, 2), i.e. his juristic
learning: or (on the analogy of the expressions quoted above) ‘ the
honour of the state.' disgraced by baseness in so eminent a citizen.

l. 9. o. 71. religio, here ⁸ a religious difficulty: 01 question: cp. below
(‘de religionibus ’). ’

1. 10. pro valetudine Augustae: cp. c. 64, 1.

1. 12. nullum . . . erat. A temple so designated is known to have
existed earlier in Rome, but may have perished at the time here
spoken of.

l. 13. Antium. Fortune was especially worshipped in this town
(Hor. Od. 1. 35, 1), and may have had more than one temple there.
The famous one is called that of the ‘ Fortunae Antiates.’

1. 14. caerimonias, ‘forms of worship : ' cp. c. 60, 3, etc.

1. 15. iuris . . . Romani esse, inserted to show that the gift might be
dedicated as lawfully at Antium as at Rome.·

1. 17. dilatum nuper: cp. c. 59, 1.

l. 19. quotiens, etc. This would mean that the flamen could be
absent for one or two nights at discretion ; but that any further absence

· required the permission of the chief pontifis, who could allow it only on

the plea of illness‚ and not even on that plea at all times or more than
twice a year. Some have thought that the rule could not have been so
severe, and that the text requires correction3 but the old ordinanoe given
in Livy (5. 52, 13) is still more stringent (⁴ flamini Diali noctem unam
manere extra urbem nefas est ’).
1. 22. in annum: cp. the Greek construction εἰς μίαν ἡμέραν (Thuc.
6. 16, 6). .

sors Asiae. see c. 32, 2: 58. 1.
1. 28. 0. 72. Lepidus. It would appear that Marcus Lepidus (see
on c. 32, 2) 1s meant; and perhaps the praenomen should be inserted.

by the grandfather of this LepiduS, and dedicated by his son Paulus
Aemilius Lepidus, the husband of Cornelia (Prop. 5. 11), in B.C. 34.
1. 30. etiam turn. In the time of Tacitus himself all such acts were
those of the princeps: cp. ‘ adhue‚' 2. 33, 2.
