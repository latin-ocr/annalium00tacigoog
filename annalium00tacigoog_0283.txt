some river east of the Weser‚ such as the Leine or Aller, and had prob-
ably turned northward towards the frontier of the Angrivarii. The
topography cannot be identified from the description, and seems hardly
to be clearly conceived by the writer.

1. 6. Angrivarii. · see on c. 8, 4. They occupied part of the modern
Hanover.

hie, sc. ‘in aggere!

1. 10 ,ω locos, ‘their separate positione· ' so in 13. 36, 1; 51.
32,1(see on 1. 61, 2).

L 11. prompta, ‘what was evident‚’ a rare sense, but in Cicero, etc. ’
Ηο10 11 refers to the infantry on the ‘agger,' as ‘ occulta' to the horse·
men in the woods.

1. 12. Seio Tuberoni: cp. 4. 29, 13 a brother of Seianus.

1. 14. eniteretur. This verb has usually the accus, with ‘in,' as in
α 80» 7³ 1· 65, 9³ 70, 6·

1. 15. sibi, sc. ‘ sumpsit,’ supplied by zeugma from ‘permisit.’

l. 16. succederent=‘scanderent:’ cp. c. 81, 2.

l. 17. superne, here an attributive adj.. like ‘comminus,' in ς 4
(Introd. p. 18, ξ 42).

l. 18. funditores libritoresque. Both of these are slingers, appa-
rently distinguished by a difference in the missiles which they hurled.
Those of the latter are called ⁸ librilia: and appear to have been stones
of considerable size bound to a leather strap.

1. 22. praetoriis cohortibus: see c. 16, 5.

1. 23. conlato gradu, ‘foot to foot,’ repeated from H. 2. 42, 4: cp.
‘ eontulit gradum‚' Liv. 7. 33, 1 1.

1. &Qum-,non colligeret, ‘could not recover’ (potential subjunct.).
The word is explained by the resemblance of the movement to that of

a conflict is mentioned 111 0. 14, 3.

adsultibus, only here and in Verg. Aen. 5. 442.

1. 30. adpressum, ⁸ closely covering,' a very rare word. The curved
form of the ‘ scutum' is contrasted with the broad flat German shield.

insidens, ⁸ firmly grasping.’

1. 31. ora foderet: see c. 14, 4.

1. 32. inprompto, only found previously in Liv. 7. 4, 5. Tacitus is
fond of using compounds of this form: see Introd. p. 18, ξ 43 b.

l. 33. vulnus: see c. 17, 5

P.96,1.1. tota volitantem acie, local abl. The whole expression
is taken from Liv. 4. 19, 2.

1 3. insisterent,‘ persist in the camage.’ Such wholesale massacre
(cp. c. 2 5, 4³ 1. 51, 2: 56, 3) was perhaps regarded as righteous ven-
geance for Varus, but is hardly exceptional in Roman warfare with
barbariam.
