300 TA CI TUS .· ANNALS.

l. 32. parentemt see o. 55, 4.

l. 33. si iure ageretur, etc. On the reminiscence here of Livy, see
Introd. p. 22, § 58, 2.

Ρ. 125,1. 1. pro munimentis, not here in the more usual sense
(see c. 13, 4), but ‘outside the fortifications' like ‘pro castris· 3. 20, 2.
The context here requires this meaning.

l. 2. dempto, ‘precipitous3' as in 4. 45, 1. The abl. here is that
of place (Introd. p. 11, ξ 14).

l. 3. ordinibus ac subsidiis, ‘ in centuries and reserves; ' abl. of
manner (Introd. p. 12, 5 16).

l. 4. asperitas, used with some harshness in two distinct senses.
Vergil uses ‘asper ' as an epithet of warlike nations or persons (Aen. 1.
14; 11. 664).

l. 5. in manus, ‘to close quarters.'

l. 7. eniterentur: cp. the similar use of ‘enisus ' in 1. 70, 6.

l. 9. c. 81. adpugnare, a Tacitean word, used of a seint attack in 4.
48, 4 3 15. 13, 1 ; and so perhaps here.

1. 1o. pro muris, not here in the sense of e. 80, 53 but ‘standing
forth on the walls‚’ as in c. 13, 4, etc.

l. 11. adflictando‚ ‘buffeting :’ ep. ‘mulieres adflictare se‚‘ Sall. Cat.
31. 3. Ι
praemiis, i. e. by the promise of a bribe (see Introd. p. 20, ξ 53).

1. 14. occanere, a rare word, adopted from Sall. Fr. (cornicines
occanuere’).

peti aggerem, ‘that earth for a mound be collected· (cp. 1. 65,
10), in order to fill the ditch and make the wall easier to scale: hence
the addition ‘ erigi scalas?

l. 15. succedere: cp. c. zo, 3.

l. 16. maneret == ‘manere sineretur :’ cp. 1. 79, 1.

l. 20. c. 82. valetudo, se. ‘adversa’ as in c. 69, 5; 3. 3, 2 3 58, 2, etc.

l. 21. ut = ‘ut fieri solet :’ cp. 1. 65, 4, etc. .

‘in ’ in such constructionS, see Introd. p. 17, ξ 38.

l. 22. dolor ira, sc. ‘erantz' ‘ erumpebant questus ’ being added with

spoken ofin c. 43, 5.

1. 25. de Druso. His republican leanings are mentioned in 1. 34. 13
his popularity and early death in c. 41, 5 : the contemporary testimony
of Livy ascribes his death to a fall from his horse: but an idle tale,
disbelieved even by Suetonius, represented him as poisoned.

civiliat cp. 1. 33, 5. ‘Regnantibus ' is used bitterly of the princeps:
cp. ‘domus regnatrix' 1. 4, 4.
