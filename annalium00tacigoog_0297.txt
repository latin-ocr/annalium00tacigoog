names of their own (see c. 45, 1), extending from the Danube to the
Baltic. The consolidation of many of these under the kingly power of
Maroboduus (see below and c. 63) was the greatest union of Germans
with which Rome had had to deal.

1. 8. ao vacui. It is probable that ‘ ac ’ may be an error arising out
of the first syllable of ‘vacui.’ If it is retained, it may mean that not
only were the Romans gone, but that the Germans were free from all
fear of any foreigner, and the abl. ‘discessu ’ might be taken like ‘ visu '
in 3. 14, 3. ⁸ Et tum ' adds a further motive acting upon them at that
time: that both claimed the glory of successful resistance to Rome.

1. 12. habebat, used harshly in two senseS, being equivalent, in the
first clause, to ‘freddebat and, in the second, to ‘sequebatun’ Ar·
minius, though of the Cheruscan royal family, djd not at this time (see
c. 88, 3) aim at kingly power.

1. 15. e. 45. Semnones, a tribe between the Elbe and the Oder,
spoken of as numerically the most important division of the Suebi.

Langobardi, also written ‘Longobardi,’ the Lombards of later
history, *at that time a distinguished, but not numerous, Suebic tribe,
living apparently beyond the Elbe.

1. 16. Inguiomerus: see 1. 60, 1, etc.

1. 20. vagis incursibus, abl. of manner, denoting the mode of attack,
and answering to the accus. with ‘per ’ in the next clause.

1. 23. ut quosque advectus erat, ⁶ as he rode up to each division ς’
· the aecus, pers· with ‘advehor’ is found elsewhere only in Verg. Aen.
8. 136.

1. 25. ostentabat, taken by zeugma, in some such sense as ‘memo-
rabat‚’ with '⁶ libertatem ' and ‘ legiones.' “

L 26. Hercyniae, sc. ‘silvae ς’ the name of a very wide tract, but
here specially of Bohemia, where Maroboduus had a stronghold, and
into which he retreated before the Romans, See c. 46, 2.

1. 30. meminissent: cp. c. 15, 4.

l. 31. penes utros, etc„ ‘who were masters in the war as a whole'

41, 3. That Arminius was the real liberator of Germany, and was not
vanquished in the issue of the war, is admitted by Tacitus (c. 88, 3).

P. 109, 1. 4. e. 46. vagas, probably to be understood of their

1. 7. legionibus, instrumental abl. See Introd. p. 12, ξ 15.
