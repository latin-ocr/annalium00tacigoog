262 TACJTUS: ANNALS.

1. 12. hino vel illino adpellerent, ⁴ might row to shore either wayz’
‘adpellere’ is thus used, in a neut. sense, in c. 77, 53 4. 27, 13 67,
2, etc.

1. 13. pontibus, probably partial decks across the midships, having
the appearance os a bridge when viewed from the prow or stem.

1. 14. velis habiles, etc. This applies to the whole fleet, to which
the other nominatives (‘aliae‚' etc.) are in apposition. ‘Citae ’ is best
taken as a participle: ships of this description could hardly be either
sailed or rowed ‘quickly ;‘ and the words probably mean only that they
were equipped for either mode of propulsion.

1. 15. augebantur, etc. It is probably meant that the spirit of the
soldiers who manned it made the fleet still more imposing and for-
midable. On the force of ‘ in,’ see Introd. p. 17, 5 38.

insula Batavorum. The situation of this island is indicated by
the context to be between the branches of the Rhine, as at that time
divided.

1. 17. adpulsus, ‘ landing-places z ’ cp. ‘ adpellerent,’ above.

transmittendum, ‘to carry into the enemy‘s country.’ On the co·
ordination of accus, with prep. and simple dat„ see Introd. p. 21,

1. 18. uno alveo continuus, etc. ς descriptive of its whole course
down to this point.

1. 19. velut, i. e. not strictly into two; for only one branch retains
the name. The true Rhine of Tacitus is the stream, now insignificant²

-but still called the old Rhine, passing by Utrecht and Leyden.

1. 21. praevenitur = ‘praetervehiturz' so ⁸ praefluere‘ (c. 63, 1),
‘praelegere ' (c. 79, 1), and others, are used for forms compounded
with ‘praeter.’

donee, with subjunct. of facts, as in 1. 1, 4, etc.

l. 23. id quoque, etc. The construction is carried on as if the
preceding clause had been ‘ Vahalis . . . vocatur!

1. 26. o. 7. adiguntur, ‘ are being brought together?

1. 27. in Chattosz see 1. 55,1. ι

l. 28. castellum, apparently not that called ‘Aliso ' below, but one
further to the east.

P. 90, 1. ,1, Druso sitam, ‘erected to Drusus! This use of ‘situs’
(cp. 3. 38, 6; 4. 55, 6, ete.) is peculiar to Tacitus; a nearly similar
use is noted onq1. 39, 4.

princeps . . . decucurrit, ‘he led the funeral march? This
‘decursio funebrisss a march in full armour round the pyre or altar, is
alluded to in Verg. Aen. 11. 188.
