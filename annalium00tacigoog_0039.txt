prerogative of pardon is thus vested in him ¹.

By a third power, that of the ‘ regimen legum et morum,’ he
retained to himself the most important powers belonging to the
ancient censorship ², such as the revision of the lists of senators
and knights, and the expulsion of unworthy members of those

to Β. e. 2 3³ Tiberius held it three times during his principato.
