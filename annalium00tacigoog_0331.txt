NOTES. Boos< [Π. CHAPs. 22-26. 317

1. ²5· amicitia . . . prohiberetur: cp. c. 12,4; 2. 70, 3.

1. 26. demonstrari, ‘ was indicated by it.’

1. 28. potentia = ‘ per potentiam,' a kind of quasi-instrumental‚ or
eausal (cp. 4. 43, 4) abl.: see [ntrod. p. 12, §5 15, 18. It is possible
that ‘ fretus ’ may have dropped out by standing near ‘fratris.’

1. 30. peregrinatione, emphatic, as his absence was voluntary:
‘longinqua’ is used of time, as in 1. 53, 3.

1. 32. sibi tamen, etc, i. e. the renouncement of friendship would be
kept up. This, it will be observed, sufficed to exclude him from all the
magistracies of the state.

P. 141, 1. 3. c. 25. Papia Poppaea, sc. ‘.lege ’ This was passed m
A. D. 9, in the names of the coss. suffecti of that year, and absorbed into
itself the earlier‘ lex Iulia de maritandis ordinibus,’ passed in Β. C. 18,
and alluded to by Horace (Carm. Sace. 17-20).

1. 4. incitandis caelibum poenis, ‘ to encourage the enforcement
of penalties on celibacy,’ especially by offering rewards to informers
,(ο. 28, 4). Penalties already existed, but were probably also increased
in severity3 the principal of them consisting in a disability to receive
inheritances or legacies except from very near relations. Childless
married persons forfeited half of such bequests.

1. 5. augendo aerario. Property left to those thus debarred from
taking it (⁴ caducum ⁹) might go to other heirs or legatees who had
children, but in default of such, escheated to the treasury.

1. 6. praevalida orbitate, ‘ childlessness being too powerful ’ (cp.
‘praevalida vitia‚‘ c. 53, 2), by reason of the court paid in society to
such persons (see Hor. Sat. 2. 5, 28 ; Juv. 4. 193 12. 99, etc.).

1. 7. periclitantium, ‘exposed to prosecution ι’ cp. e. 12, 9.

1. 8. interpretationibus, ‘‚’constructions straining the law to include
more cases under it.

1. 9. ea res, ‘this fact,’ i. e. the oppressive working of this particular
law.. ·
1.11. altius disseram, a new phrase, analogous to ‘altius coniectare?

1. 32, 7 (where see note).

1. 12. o. 26. Vetustissimi mortalium. This view of a primitive
golden age is taken by Tacitus from the Stoic philosophy of his time,
with perhaps also a reminiscence of Sall. Cat. 2. 1, etc. The Epicurean
view is set forth in Lucr. 5. 1105—1160, and humorously touched in a
few lines by Horace (Sat. 1. 3, 99, foll).

1. 14. neque, answering to ‘et . . . nihil (equivalent to ‘neque . . .
quidquam ’) . . . vetabantur.’

suopte ingenio, best taken as causal abl. (Introd. p. 12, 5 18):
‘virtue used to be sought from (i. e. ‘from a love for’) its own quali-
ties.⁹ The same words (‘ suopte ingenio ') occur in a fragment of Sallust,
