246 TA CI TUS .· ANNALS.

l. 7. c. 59. invitis aut· cupientibus. This attracted dative is an
extension of the Graecism elsewhere restricted in Latin to ‘ volenti ’ and
⁶ volentibus,’ which are thus used in a few places (see Roby, 1152).

ape vel dolore, abl. of manner: see Introd. p. 12, 5 16.

1. 8. rapta uxor, etc.. ‘the thought of his wife’s seizure and the en·
slavement of her unborn child: ’ cp. Introd. p. 16, 5 36.

l. 13. sibi, dat. commodi, as is also ⁸ sibi . . . firmabat,' c. 71, 5.

legatos. Probably here and in c. 61, 6, the ‘legati legionum’ (see
on c. 44, 3) are meant.

1. 18. sacerdotium hominum, ‘ his priesthood to a man.’ He was
probably priest to Augustus (e. 39, 1 ; 57, 2), ‚whose divinity Arminius
thus contemptuously denies (cp. below, 5 7). Several other readings
have been suggested, but this sense appears to be satisfactory.

Germanos, etc. Stress seems to be laid on ‘ Germanos’ (‘ true
Germans ⁹), in indignant contrast to SegesteS, and the sentence ‘ quod . . .
viderint ’ forms the object of ‘ excusaturos; ’ the meaning being that they
could never make sufficient apology to themselves (never forgive them-
selves) for having allowed the insignia of Roman occupatiori to be ever
seen between the Rhine and Elbe.

l. 2ο. aliis gentibus, etc„ i. e. those who knew it not might think it
good for them. ‘ Ignorantia' is causal abl. (cp. c. 57, 2).

1. 21. nescia=‘ignota:’ so in Plautus

1. 23. delectus, probably an ironical allusion to him as professedly
princeps by the state's free choice (c. 7, 10).

1. 2 5. colonias novas, ⁶ new settlementS,' such as those of many
tribes, and now of Segestes and his train, on the ⁴ victa ripa.'

l. 28. c. 60. sed, without ‘ etiam‚’ as in c. 81, 1 3 2. 14, 3, etc.:
‘etiam’ is also used without ‘ sed ’ (Introd. p. 17, 5 40).

l. 31. quadraginta cohortibuS, the four legions of the lower army
(c. 64, 8). l

1. 33. mittit. This verb is thus used with gerundive dat. of purpose
(Introd. p. 11, 5 11) in 2. 1, 2.

finibus, local abl. indicating direction, like ⁶ via‚’ etc.: see Introd.

. 1 1, 5 14. ·

P Frisiorum. This tribe, at that time subject to Rome (see 4. 72, 1),
occupied most of the coast of Holland, where part of their territory still
retains the name of F riesland.

P. 76 l. 2. lacus: cp. 2. 8, 1. These lakes are now merged in the
Zu1 er Zee.

l. 3. Chauci: see c. 38, 1.

l. 5. L. stertinius, mentioned often in these campaignS, and always
as a leader of cavalry and light troops (c. 71, 1; 2. 8, 4; 11, 43 17, 1;

22, 3).
