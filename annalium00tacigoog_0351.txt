NOTES. BOOK III. CHAPS. 59-63. 337

1. 31. cum Lydia poteretur. He is generally represented as having
been there the slave of Omphale (Soph. Trach. 248, etc.).

caerimoniam, ⁶ sanctity,’ a sense restricted to the singular (cp. 4.
64, 5, etc.).

1. 32· dicione, abl. of time: cp. ‘triumviratu ’ (c. 28, 3), etc.

P. 159, 1. 1. c. 62. Magnetes, the people of Magnesia on the Maean-
der, distinct from ‘ Magnesia a Sipylo ’ (2. 47, 4). It was the first city to
join Rome after the defeat os Antiochus (B. c. 190), and the only city in
Asia which held out for Rome against Mithridates (Β. C. 88).

1. 3. decoravere, ‘ honoured by the grant.’

1. 4. Leucophrynae, named from Leucophrys, an older town on the
site of Magnesia.

Aphrodisienses, etc. Aphrodisias and Stratoniceia are in Caria.
The language is concise even to ambiguousnesS, as the decree of the dic-
tator refers to the former, that of Augustus to the latter city.

1. 7. Parthorum inruptionem, that led by Q. Labienus in
B. e. 40.

1. 8. sed, marking a return from a digression, as in 1. 74, 3, etc.

L 10. altius . . . exposuere, ‘made out a case with deeper founda—
tion’ (more remote date): ‘altius’ has this force in c. 25, 3. Hiero·
caesarea is in Lydia.

l. 11. rege (ἔπι-οε( regnante Cyro ε’ cp. ⁸ principe Augusto,' c. 71, 3.

L 12. Perpennae, Isaurici. The former was the conqueror and
captor os Aristonicus of Pergamum in Β. C. 130, the latter was proconsul

of Asia in Β. C. 46.
1. 13. duobus milibus passuum, i.e. a radius· of that distance

round it.

l. 14. tribus de delubris, sc. ‘ exposuere.‘ The prep. appears to have
been lost in the first syllable of ⁴ delubris!

1. 15. quorum, etc. Some obscurity here results from the attempt to
combine concisely the mention of the looelity of the three temples
(Paphos, AmathuS, Salamis), the worship to which they were dedicated,
and the names of their founders.

auctor, ‘founder :’ so ‘ auctorem . . . Ptolemaeum‚’ H. 4. 84, 6.
1. 17. ¹I.'euce1·: cp. Hor. Od. 1. 7, 21, foll.
posuissent, ‘had founded! The subjunct. appears to be used be-
cause this forms part of the statement of the CyprianS.

l. 18. c. 63. quorum, ‘such things π’ the word refers to the whole
matter.

1. 19. studiis, partialities of certain senators to particular cities.

1. 20. si, best taken as depending on ‘perspect0‚’ with the sense of
‘whether ’ (cp. 1. 48, 1).

involveretur, ⁸ should be fraudulently concealed in the claim.'
