1. NEw WoRDs OR NEW SENsEs OF WORDS.

43 [69]. Many of the words apparently invented by Tacitus
fall under the following heads.

(a) Vel-bal substantives.

(1) in ‘-tor,’ ‘-sor,’ and ‘-tn‘x,·’ as adcumulator 3. 30, 23 con-
demnator 4. 66, 13 defector 1. 48, 13 exstimulator 3. 40, 1 ; reg-
natrix 1. 4, 43 sanctor 3. 26, 6 ; subversor 3. 28, 1.

(2) in ‘·us’ (genit. ‘ ·us’) and in ‘ mentum,·’ as provisus (only
in abl.) 1. 27, 23 imitamentum 3. 5⁸, 6, &c. The large number
of words of each of these classes used is highly characteristic of
TacituS, as also the preference, in his choice between forms in
‘-men’ and ‘·mentum‚’ for whichever is the more unusual.

(b) Negative words formed with ‘in 3’ as inprosper 3. 24,
23 inreligiose 2. 50, 2 ; inturbidus 3. 52, 1.

(c) 'words with the prefix ‘per ’ and ‘ prae ς’ as peramoe-
nus 4. 67, 3; perstimulare 4. 12, 73 pervigere 4. 34, 63 prae-
gracilis 4. 57, 3.

(d) Frequentauve verbs ; as appellitare 4. 66, 1. A general
tendency to prefer such verbs to the simple forms is noticeable.

Many other new πινυτᾶς, not classified, are noted where they
occur.

44 [71]. 'I'he following are among the words used by
Tacitus in a. sense peeuliar to himself, advertere (in ali-
quem = to punish) 2. 32, 53 amovere (to banish) 1. 53, 63
conexus (of relationship) 2. 50, 1 ; gnarus (= notus) 1. 5, 43
proicere (to defer) 2. 36, 3.

Many of the syntactical usages already mentioned are also to
be noted among the innovations of Tacitus.
