PREFACE.

Tru: Introduction and notes here given are mainly abridged
from the corresponding portion of the larger edition pub-
lished last year3 to which, in the Chapter on Syntax and
Style, references throughout are made, to assist any teachers
or students who may desire to supplement the present from
the former work.

In a few instanceS, in this edition, a different text is given, ·
chiefly in accordance with changes in the fourth edition of
Halm (1883).¹ Opportunity has also been taken of amend-
ing some of the explanations in the noteS.

The references here given are almost wholly restricted to
the books of Tacitus contained in this volume, and to such
other ancient authors or modern works as are well known to
schoolboyS.

Ι have also generally in this edition omitted to specify the
editors or' other writers to whom I am indehted‚ in the hope
that it will be generally understood that the acknowledgments
of obligation, freely made throughout the larger volume, are
indirectly applicable here.
