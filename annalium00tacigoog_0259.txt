NOTES. Boos( J. CHAPS. 54-58. 245

L 14. inoffensum, ‘ uninterrupted ε ’ this sense, and the transitive use
of ‘ properare‚' are chiefly poetical.

1. 1 7. Adranam, the Eder‚ which takes a north-easterly course, and,
a little above Cassel, joins the Fulda‚ itself a tributary of the Weser.

1. 24. Cheruscis. This great tribe had been, ever since the rising
against Varus, at the head of the German resistance. Tbeir locality
was in parts of Hanover, Brunswick‚ etc„ but their confederation extended
further to the west.

l. 3ο. c. 57. quanto . . . promptus. On such abbreviations of com-
parative sentenceS, see Introd. p. 17, ξ 40.

1. 32. conscientia: cp. c. 39. 3. The abl.. as also ‘ memoria ’ (ξ 6)
is causal (see Introd. p. 12, 5 18).

l. 33. anno quo, etc. The plural ‘ Germaniae ’ generally denotes the
two Roman provinces; and the rising of ΑΛ). 9 is here assumed to be
the revolt of a country subject to Rome.

P. 4 L 1. aram Ubiorum: cp. c. 39, 1.

4. pretiumz‘operae pretium,' as in 2. 35, 1, etc. The abbrevia-
tion appears to be peculiar to Tacitus.

1. 7. uxor, etc. Her name, according to Strabo, was Thusnelda.

l. 8. animo, abl. of quality.

inlacrimas, ‘:soastoshedtears ’ cp. Introd. p. 17, §38-

l.12. bonae societatis, ‘alliance faithfully kept; ' like ‘bona
fidesss etc.

L 17. o. 58. ex, ‘in accordanee with,’ like ‘ex sententia‚' ‘ex more‚’ etc.

L 19. conducere, sc. ‘iudicabam' supplied by zeugma from ‘ pro—
babam :⁹ see Introd. p. 20, § 52; and, on the omission of ‘magis’ before
‘quam‚’ see Id. p. 17, ξ 40.

L 24. nox, that of the banquet (c. 55, 3).

L 2 5. quae secuta. This glances at his share in hostilitieS, as ‘con-
sensu gentis in bellum tractus' (c. 55, 4).

l. 27. tui eopia, ‘aceess to you ε ’ more commonly ⁴ conveniendi ⁹ is
added.

l. 28. antehabeo. This word is found only here and in 4. 11, 5.

1. 32. utrum praevaleat, ‘ which should have more weight with you.’ ’

Q 1. 2. vetere, the province on the Gallie side of the Rhine.
It is assumed, as above (c. 57, 2) that further Germany is also part of
the province, though in revolt.

nomen imperatoris: see on c. 3, 1. We see here that it was
given by decree of the senate, on the motion of the princeps,

1. 3. virilis sexus. His name is given by Strabo as Thymelicus;
but any subsequent mention of him by Tacitus has been lost.

1. 5. conflictatus est, ⁶ was harassed : ¹ cp. 2. 20, 3, etc.

in tempore, ‘at the proper timez’ cp. c. 19, 2.
