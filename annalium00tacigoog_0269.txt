l. 7. veritati=‘aequitati : ’ cp. 3. 16, 5, and ‘ex vero,’ 4. 43, 4. The
‘libertas’ here contrasted with it is the independence of judgeS.

1. 8. inter quae, etc. This narrative is apparently one of a petition
to the senate, inserted here as bearing on the interest of Tiberius in
questions of justice.

1. 19. aerarii praetoribus. The public treasury was then under the
charge of two of the praetors of the year. Caesar gives the money him-

he might live on a less expensive scale, and would be free to trade as

rare.
γ relabentem . . . strages. Probably ‘ relabentem ’ is aoristic, and

‘strages' is used both of the fall of buildings, and of mortality (through
pestilence bred by stagnant water) among human beings; the latter
being the most usual occasion for consulting the Sibylline bookS, then
preserved in the temple of the Palatine Apollo, under charge of the

lonica and Philippi.

1. 25. levari . . . placuit, ‘ it was resolved that they should be for

over to Caesar! The Caesarian provinces appear generally to have
