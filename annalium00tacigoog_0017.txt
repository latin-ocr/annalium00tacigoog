LIFE ΛΝΒ WORKS OF TACITUS. 3

he gives such prominence ; probably also some published
speeches¹‚ especially those addressed by the princeps to the
senate²; while his full record of the transactions of that body
appears to have been directly or indirectly derived either from
the minutes kept of its proceedings³ or from published letters
containing similar accounts to such as are given by Cicero of
the course of the debate‚ the feeling of the house, and impression
made by speakers,

It is to be noted that Tacitus considers his authors in general
to be more or less untrustworthy, as having written in a spirit
either of servility towards the prince under whom they lived or
of rancour towards one recently deceased ⁴. As the then existing
histories of Tiberius are believed to have been written mostly
after his death ⁶, they may be supposed to have abounded in
such invective and insinuation against the great reputed enemy
of the house of Germanicus as would be acceptable to Gaius,
to ClaudiuS, or to Nero ; and TacituS, who can be shown occa-
sionally to reject a scandalous tale⁶ or imputation ⁷, and to re-
cognise, however grudgingly, an act of justice or liberality ⁸, may

. have sincerely believed that he was treating with impartiality

the memory of one who had been too darkly painted.

His ¹professed purpose in writing is to hold up signal examples
of political vice and virtue for posterity to execrate and to
admire ⁹, and to teach his readers, even through a narrative
which he fears by its monotonous horrors may weary them ¹⁰,
that good citizens can live under bad rulers 3 and that it is not
mere destiny or the chapter of accidentS, but personal character

¹ See note on 3. 13, 3. ² See 1. 81, 1; 2. 63, 4.

⁸ The ⁸ acta senatus’ are not expressly mentioned in the first six
Books; the ‘acta populi,’ or public jour-hals», are once referred to
(3· 3, ²)-

⁴ 1. 1, 5.

⁵ The short sketch contained in the last nine chapters of Velleius
PaterculuS‚ is the only historical work known even by name to uz, in
which the‘ res Tiberii’ are treated‘ florente ipso!

⁶ See 4.11. '¹ 1. 76, 7.

⁸ See especially the general sketch of the best period of the rule of
Tiberius given in 4. 6, also the notice of particular acts in 1. 75, 2. 47,
