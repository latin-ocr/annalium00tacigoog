278 TA CITUS: ANNALS.

1. 28. dilatae, a variation from the usual ⁸ prolatae!

1. 30. c. 36. in quinquennium, ‘ for five years in advances‘ To
bring such a proposal into force, the magistrates for the next five years
would be nominated at once, and afterwardS‚ annually‚ those for the
fifth year from date.

1. 31. utque legionum legati. The indic. ‘fungebantur ' shows
that those actually then serving in that rank are meant. Their whole
number, answering to that of the legions (Introd. p. 30), would be
twenty-five, of whom probably some had already been praetore. The
remainder would be destined or designated as such from the date of this
motion (⁴ iam tum’); with them the princeps was to nominate others as
praetors designate to make up a total of sixty, distributed in groups of
twelve over the five years. On the number of praetors, and on the
‘nominatio ’ by the princeps, see on 1. 14, 6.

P. 103, l. 1. arcana imperii: cp. c. 59, 4; 1. 6, 6. Such a scheme
really bound his choice for five years in advance.

1. 2. quasi augeretur. His power would apparently by five years
outlast his life; but such posthumous choice was often set aside.

l. 3. moderationi z cp. ‘modestia' 1. 1 1, 1, etc.

tot eligere, referring to the immediate choice of sixty praetors, etc.

1. 7. mens, domun, fortuna, ⁶ sentimenta family conditions‚ circum·
stanceS.' A man’s ‘domus' might be changed by'his adoption, or he
might gain a preferential claim by having children (cp. c. 51, 2). ⁴ For-
tuna’ is thus used in c. 38, 93 4. 23, 2.

1. 8. annua, ‘a year in advance.’

1. 9. agitent, sc, ‘animo‚’ ‘assumed the airs of magistrates! The
⁶ magistratus designati ‘ had a quasi-official position, especially in the
· senate3 so it is rhetorically said that magistrates would be multiplied
fivefold (‘quinquiplicari.' ἄπ’. dp.)-

1. 12. favorabili, ‘ popular :’ cp. ‘haec favorabili oratione praemisit‚’
12. 6, 1. For ‘ in speciem,' cp. 1. 52, 2, etc.

1. 13. ο. 37. censusque, etc. For other instances of this, see 1. 75, 5.

quo magis. The MS. has ‘ quod 3 ’ but the occurrence of the same
word twice in a sentence in different senses is awkward. The plup.
subjunct ‘accepisset ' is used as giving the view of persons at the time.

1. 16. inlectus, ‘induced’ For the inf. with this word, cp. Introd.

. 14, ξ 27.
p liberalitate, abstr. for coner„ used specially of imperial gifts to
individuals, as in 4. 20, 1, etc. The gift amounted to the sum fixed as
the senatorial census (1. 75, 5), and appears to have been already
squandered.

1. 19. loco sententiae: see c. 33, 2.

l. 20. eitam: cp. c. 7, 33 1. 39, 4, etc.
