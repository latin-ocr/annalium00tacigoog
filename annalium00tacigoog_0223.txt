THE CHIEF EVENTS BETWEEN THE END OF
BOOK IV. AND THE DEATH OF TIBERIUS.

⁷ EARLY in A.D.s29 died Iulia Augusta, the mother of Tiberim, at
the age of eighty-six. That she had been a protectress of the
house of Germanicus appears from the fact that, almost imme-
diately after her death, letters were despatched to the senate
denouncing Agrippina and Nero, The latter was decreed to be
a public enemy, and both were hurried into imprisonment in
separate islands¹. ·

In A. D. 30, the second son, Drusus, who had been used by
Seianus as a tool against his brother, was condemned by a similar

arrestedand sent back to Rome and there kept in custody.

or the daughter of DrusuS‚ the emperor’ s son. Also‘ 1n this year
Tiberius had so far overcome hilsshesitation as to order the exe-
cution or compel the suicide of ero. Yet Drusus and Agrippina
were living on; Gaius was still in favour and generally regarded
as the heir3 and these circumstanceS‚ added to sundry indications

neighbouring Pontia (Ponza).
