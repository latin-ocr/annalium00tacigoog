was arranged, which connexion is represented as having ensnared him
(‘subdola affinitas ’).

l. 33. Lollianas· Lollius was defeated, with the loss of an eagle, by
some German tribes in B.C. 16. On the defeat of VaruS, see c. 3, 6, etc.

P. 50, 1. 1. Vmones, etc. These pluraIS, like ‘Lollianas’ and
‘ Var1anas,‘ are rhetorical, and refer to Terentius Varro Muraena and
Egnatius Rufus, put to death for conspiracies in B.c. 23 (or 22) and 19,
and Iulus Antonius son of the triumvir, forced to suicide in B.C. 2 for
adultery with Iulia (see 4. 44, 5).

1. 2. abducta, etc. Here, as in c. 9, 4, a verb of speaking, such as

knight of immense wealth, is noted for having thrown live slaves into a
pond to feed his lampreyS, even in the presence of Augustus.

1. 5. gravis. She had helped to destroy the commonwealth by pro-
vidinga master for it in her son, and was supposed to have destroyed her
stepsons to make room for him (see c. 3, 3). ‘ In rempublicam ’ may be
taken as in c. 8, 7, or as nearly equivalent to a simple dat. (see c. 76,Δ 5).

1. 7. numinum= ‘ quales numinum esse solent,’ i. e. statues represeht-
ing him with divine attributeS, as the thunderbolt, ete.

1. 10. deterrima= ‘ cum deterrimo homine ι ’ the inexactness of ex-
pression is due to the desire of brevity.

l. 13. honora, one of the words found in no earlier prose author

respecting his deportment‚ style of dress (cp. 2. 59, 3; 75, 3) and man-
ners’ (so ‘instituta Parthorum,’ 6. 32, 4). His taciturnity and apparent
superciliousness (cp. c. 4, 3) gave general offence.

l.14. velut excusando. The apparent excuse offered conveyed a
taunt. Augustus is stated to have said that Tiberius could not help his
peculiarities. κ

1. 20. quam arduum, sc. ‘esset ⁹ (see Introd. Ρ. 14, ὁ 25). “

see that they saw through his insincerity.
