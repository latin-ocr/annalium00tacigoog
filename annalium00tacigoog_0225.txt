APPENDIX. 2 1 1

period may not be more, but can hardly be lesS, than from eighty
to a hundred, ranging from the upstart creatures of Seianus to
the highest rank in Rome. Agrippina, her son Drusus, Asinius
Gallus, perished in prison by voluntary or enforced starvation:
Mamercus Scaurus ¹, the unworthy last representative of a
famous house, paid the penalty of a supposed allusion in a
tragedy: Lucius Arruntius ², then the most distinguished mem-
ber of the senate, after enduring for more than ten years the
mockery of nominally governing Spain, while he was jealously
detained in Rome, threw up his life in wearineSS‚ at a charge
preferred in the very last days of TiberiuS, and perhaps without
his knowledge, by Macro: Cocceius Nerva, the greatest living
jurist, had previously adopted a similar course from mere disgust,
while unassailed and still intimate with the prince: it was noted
as rare when an eminent senator died a natural death, as the city
praefect L. Piso, his successor Aelius Lamia, or one so just and
independent as Manius Lepidus,

The only important episode in these weary years is that of
a movement in the East in A. D. 35, 363 when Tiberius, stung by
the taunts and aggression of Artabanus ³, who had set his son on
the throne of Armenia, displayed a temporary energy, recovered
his hold on that kingdom, and gave further support to a rival
claimant for the throne of Parthia. By the sudden vicissitudes
common in Oriental monarchies, Artabanus is seen at one
moment forsaken by all, driven from his empire, and providing
himself a bare subsistence by bow and arrows in the wilds of
Scythia3 at another, sought out by repentant subjects and re·
stored, driving his weak competitor into an ignominious shelter
within the Roman frontier.

Generally, even routine duties seem to have become neglected,
and Tiberius sank gradually into ⁴the extremity of mental and
bodily decrepitude. Gaius had held his position throughout the
period by abject obsequiousness ⁴, and by paying assiduous court
to Macro, whose power differed little in substance from that of
SeianuS, though disguised more prudently.
