272 TA CJTUS .- ANNALS.

l. 12. noviens, in nc. 9-7, A. n. 4-6, 9-11.

1. 14. Sugambros. The remnant of this tribe were settled on the
Gallie bank, probably in B. C. 8. See Hor. Od. 4. 2, 34 ; 14, 51. They
fumish contingents to the Roman army (4. 47, 5).

Suebos. On this people, see 1. 44. 6³ on Maroboduus, c. 44, 3, etc.

1. 17. internis discordiis. As an illustration of this may be in-
staneed the hostilitiea between the Cherusci and Suebi in the very next
year (c. 44, 2), and the plot of the prince of the Chatti against the life
of Arminius (c. 88, 1).

l. 19. praesens, i. e. at Rome. Germanicus had again left Rome
before he actually filled this consulship (c. 53, 1).

1. 2ο. adnectebat, used, as in 4. 28, 2, with the force and construction
of ‘ addebat!

1. 22. nomen imperatorium. This title (see on 1. 3, 1, etc.) had
been received by Germanicus (1. 58, 9); but there is no trace of its
having been ever given to Drusus.

deportare lauream, ‘ to earn the laurel wreath ς’ so ‘deportare
triumphum‚’ Cic. Off. 1. 26, etc.

1. 24. parto decori. For the dative, see c. 5, 13 Introd. p. 10, ξ 6.

1. 26,,9,,2,’ζ,Β Libo Drusus. His full name was M. Scribonius Libo Dru-
sus, and he was probably brother of the consul of this year (c. 1 , 1 ς 29, 2).

1. 27. defertur moliri: cp. ‘defertur simulavisse,’ 3. 22, 1. This
construction with verbs of accusing is especially common in the Annals
(Introd. p. 15, ξ 29). The charge of plotting a revolution (⁶ res
novae ’) is distinct from, and more specific than, that of ‘maiestas ’ (on
which see 1. 72, 3).

1. 28. curatius: cp. 1. 13, 7.

reperta sunt, etc. Delation has been already noticed (1. 72 ; 74),
but we here first find persons entrapped by intimate friends, who keep
up private communications with Caesar. By ⁸ per tot annos ’ the whole
time to the death of Domitian is meant.

1. ²9· Firmius Catus: see 4. 31, 73 ‘amicitia’ for ‘amicis,’ as in
c. 77, 1 (Introd. p. 9, ξ 1).

1. 30. facilem inanibus, ‘ easily led to empty projects 3' so ‘facilis
capessendis inimicitiis‚’ 5. 11, 1.

1. 31. Chaldaeorum, the astrologers, known also as ‘ mathematici ⁹
(c. 32, 5, etc.), and by other names, who foretold destiny from the posi·
tions of the heavenly bodies. Tiberius was himself an adept in the art
(6. 20, 3), and Tacitus is not wholly without belief in it (4. 58, 2).

magorum saera, ⁸ the rites of magicians.' These dealt in philtres
and other drugs, spells, and incantatione (see c. 28, 3, 69, 5, etc.), and
were often neither more nor less than professional poisoners.

somniorum interpretes. These have sometimes the special name

of ⁸ coniectores-⁸
