260 TA CI TUS .· ANNALS.

l. 17. trucidantium . . . exturbantium, used aoristically3 see Introd.
p. 16, § 35. Crassus was defeated and killed in B.C. 53. On the re-
pulse of Antonius, see on c. 1, 2.

l. 19. accendebat . . . et ipse, ‘his own character also’ (besides his
antecedents) ‘ was adding fire to their disdain.’

1. 21. venatu . . . cura, usually taken as abl. of quality, but perhaps
better as instrumental abl., answering to ‘ gestamine’ and ‘fastu.'

quotiens . . . incederet; subjunct. of repeated action (Introd.
p 16 ξ 34)
1. 22. gestamine. Tacitus uses this word with the defining genit.
‘sellae' in 14. 4 6, and (by itself) for‘ a litter’ in 11. 33, 3. This sense
appears to be peculiar to him.
erga, used with much freedom by Tacitus to express any kind of feeling
in relation to a person (c. 71, 4· , 76, 3, etc.), or thing (4. 20, 2 ; 74, 5, etc.).

1. 23· utensilium, ‘stores of food‘ (cp. 1. 70, 6). For such to be
sealed up with his signet-ring (‘anulo clausa’), to guard against pil-
fering slaves, would be somewhat mean in a Roman of rank <Juv. 14.
132), still more so in an Eastem king.

1. 24. prompti aditus, etc. It seems best to supply ‘ erant,' not with
these clauseS, but with ‘nova vitia‚’ taken as predicate of the whole, and
explained by '‘et quia,' ete, following. ·

obvia, ‘affable,’ i. e. ready to meet all halfway.

l. 27. ο. 3. Dahas. This Scythie race, known by name to Vergil
(Aen. 8. 728), appear to have then lived to the south-east of the Caspian.

1. 28. primoque congressu, etc. The evidence of coins shows that
the unsuccessful attempt of Artabanus was made Α. 1). 9, and that he
became king in Α. 1). 11. He is stated to have been already king of
independent Media, and to have recruited his forces from that country.

P. 88, l. 1. Parthorum et Romanas. On such variations of case,
see Introd. p. 21, ξ 54 d: also c. 17, 6; 60, 43 3. 2, 1, etc. Tacitus
cares only to explain their distrust of Rome; their hostility to Parthia
being more natural. This Artavasdes had been captured by Antonius in
Β. C. 34, and was put to death by Cleopatra soon after Actium.

1. 4. nobis infensus He is stated to have put to death all Romans
in his dominions. A

1. 7. a Tiberio Nerone. This took place when Tiberius was sent to
receive the standards of Crassus (see on c. 1, 1) ; and the transaction is
magnified by Romans (see Hor. Epp. 1. 12, 16) into a conquest of
Armenia.

1. 8. liberis. These children, joined in marriage and in regal power,
were another Tigranes (Tigranes ΙΙΙ.) and Erato. Instances of such
marriages of brother and sister are found in the royal family of Egypt
and in other Eastern monarchies.
