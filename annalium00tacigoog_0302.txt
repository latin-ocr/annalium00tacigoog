v 1. 2. Ilio. The Ilium of Roman times, to which belong the most
recent remains traceable ou the site of Hissarlik‚ had been rebuilt after
its destruction by Fimbria in Β. ο. 85. The Romans regarded it as the
representative of Homeric Troy and treated it with great respect as
their ancestral city; but it was in itself an insignificant town (see 4. 5 5,·
4). The construction is concise for ‘adito Ilio visisque quae ibi,’ etc„
and the ablatives ‘ varietate ’ and ‘ origine ’ are causal. The use of the
personal genit. (⁴ nostri ’) for a possessive is common in Tacitus.

Athenian citizen by purchase. This scandal, denounced by Demo-
sthenes, had been put a stop to by Augustus in Β. c. Π.

l. 19. violenter in suos, alluding to the many distinguished
Athenians who had been judicially condemned or ostracised.

l. 21. Areo iudicio, ἄπ. etp. for ‘ Arei pagi iudicio!

falsi damnatum, ‘convicted of forgery.' The same expression is

l. 25. raperet in abrupta, ‘ was driving him on a reef: ’ cp. c. 23,

legions.
