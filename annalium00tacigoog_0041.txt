HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION To THESE BOOKS. 27

Those, however, who could look below the surface knew well
that, not the senate, but Caesar through the senate, governed 3
and that it acted rather as representative of him than of the
state. Every magistrate was really so far his nominee that only
such candidates as had his recommendation, or at least his
approval ¹, could be chosen3 and as the entry to the senate
itself was through magistracy² or by the direct nomination of
the princeps ⁸, every senator must have felt that he owed his
position to Caesar ς, who, besides the powers formally conferred
on him, had all the advantage arising from the general recogni-
tion that, whoever was master of the legions, was master of as
much else as he thought fit to claim.

If we look to the practical working of the imperial adminis-
tration‚ the chief difference felt by the inhabitants of Rome
must have consisted in the greater maintenance of order. Seven
thousand ‘vigiles’ were distributed over the city3 a more dis-
tinctly military police force of three urban cohorts ⁴, each a
thousand strong, enforced the summary jurisdiction of the city
praefect 3 and nine praetorian cohorts ⁶ of similar strength were
at hand, if needed. This security must have been in itself no
small boon to trade and industry3 and even the poorest class
must have found their gain in the more systematic regulation
of the corn supply ⁶.

In the empire‘ outside, the most important change to notice is
the division of provinces made in B.C. 27 between Augustus ²
and the senate, whereby only the more peaceful were retained
by the latter; those lately acquired, or otherwise needing the
presence of military force, being taken over by Caesar.

Of the senatorial provinceS, the two chief were Asia and
Africa. The former, comprising a large triangular tract with
its base on the western coast of Asia Minor, included generally
Mysia, Lydia, Caria, and nearly all Phrygia, with most of the
islands in the Aegean, and had its metropolis and seat ot
government at Ephesus. The latter would coincide in modern
geography with the western part of Tripoli, the whole of Tunis‚
