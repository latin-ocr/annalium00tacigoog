10, 86), etc. 3 after the analogy of ἅμα.
l. 10. sodalibus Augustalibus: see 1. 54, 1.
1.. Apronius: see 1. 56, 1, etc.

l. 12. distincto, etc„ ‘ distinguishing the legitimate functions of the
priesthoods, and going back (cp. c. ²4· 2) for precedentsss These are
explained by ‘neque enim‚’ etc„ as showing that the ‘ fetiales,’ who pre-
sided over ceremonies of war and treatieS, had never ranked with the great
priestlyffcolleges.

1. 13. ideo Augustales, etc„ added to meet the objection that neither
were they among the old great ‘ collegia.’

1. 16. c. 65. exsequi, ‘to set forth in detail ι’ so in 4. 4, 6, etc.

1. 17. notabili dedecore, best taken as abl. of quality; ‘notabili '
being made to answer to ‘ insignes ’ rather than depend on it.

quod, explained by the following sentence, as in 4. 3, 6.
munus annalium, ‘ the office of history ς’ ⁸ annales ’ has this general
sense in 4. 32, 1, etc. ‘ Quod’ is explained by the following clause, as in

1. 2 3. pedarii senatores, those of the lower rank, who had not filled ’
a curule office. It would appear here that they were not altogether pre·
cluded from speaking; neverthelesS, they were not generally asked their
⁴ sententia: but gave their vote by swelling the ranks on a division (‘ pe-
dibus ibant in sententiam ').

1. 27. qui . . . nollet, ‘ though he 'did not wish for ;’ a rare concessive
use of the relative. ’

proiectae, ‘ abject ι’ cp. 1. 42, 4.

1. 29. c. 66. ab indecoris ad infesta, ‘ from sels-degradation to
persecution,’ i. e. to delations; by fastening an imaginary charge of
‘maiestas ⁹ on a person indicted for other offences.

l. 31. Scaurus: cp. 1. 13, 4: further account of Otho and Niger is
given below.

P. 161, 1. 1. iaciens: cp. ‘ veteres Persarum . . . terminos . . .
iaciebat,' 6. 31, 2 ς where, as here, the verb has the force of ‘ iactare.’

1.. Cottam, etc. Cotta was accused of ⁸ repetundae ’ by the younger
Scipio Africanus in B. c. 1303 Galba of cruelty and treachery in Lusitania
by Cato in Β. C. 1493 Rutilius of ‘ ambitus ’ by Scaurus, the famous
‘ princeps senatus,’ in Β. C. 116.

1. 3. videlicet, often thus used ironically by Cicer0, etc.

though skilled in concealing them; and as having undoubtedly taken
bribes from Jugurtha.
