NOTES. BooK J. CHAPS. 62-65. 249

l. 4. inclinantes, ‘giving way: ⁹ the dat. depends on ‘ exemit,’ as in
c. 48, 2.

1. 7. subiecta, i.e. ‘loca iugis subiecta:' cp. ‘subiecta vallium:
c. 65, 1.

1. 13. medio. The legions, drawn up in a ‘thiu line’ along this
‘ planities‚’ would be between the enemy on the wooded hills and the
baggage struggling along the causeway over the morasa and would be
able to hold the former in check while the latter made progress on
their way.

1. 17. c. 65. per diversa, i.e. from a different oeuse on either
side. κ l

l. 19. interruptae voc‘es, se. ‘essent’ (ep. c. 7, 1, etc.). From a
parallel passage (H. 5. 22, 5), ‘interrupto signo et vocibuS,' this would
appear to mean that the challenge of the patrol lacked its usual regu·
larity and promptness.

1. 22. dira quies. Here, as in 2. 14, 1, etc., ‘quies’ is generally
taken to mean ⁸ a dream ’ (as ‘ somnus’ in Verg. Aen. 2. 794), but might
bear its usual meaning, the dream itself being sufficiently indicated by
the epithet.

1. 23. emersum. The simple abl. with this verb (see Introd. p. 11,
ξ 13) is found also in Sallust.

l. 24. manum, ete„ ‘ thrust aside his hand as he held it out to
him? Usually ‘manum intendere ’ expresses a hostile gesture, as in 4.
3, 2, etc.

1. 26. campo umentia ultra, apparently not the ‘ planities ’ which
they were intended to occupy (c. 64, 7), but a solid spot outside the plart
of the morass furthest from the enemy. By occupying this, they eft
the baggage‚ etc., on the causeways exposed to attack.

L 28. caeno fossisque, probably an abl„ partly local, partly instru-
mental: cp. ⁴ criminibus haerebant’ (4. 19, 5) 3 ‘ haeret pede pes’ (Verg.
Aen. 10. 361): see also note on c. 68, 3.

1. 29. utque= ‘ atque, ut solet,’ etc. The ‘ut ' before ⁸ haesere,’ in the
sense of ‘ when,’ extends its force to ‘ aurea,’ and this clause, with
another ‘ ut,’ is interposed parenthetically.

P. 9 1. 1. lubrico paludum-‘lubrica palude:’ cp. c. 61, 2. etc.
‘ apsantes ’ is apparently from Vergil (Aen. 2. 551).

1. 7.‘ aperta et solida, probably a different solid spot from either of
those mentioned before, and apparently beyond the neighbourhood of
the forest: cp. ‘ non hic silvas nec paludes’ (c. 68, 4).

1. 9. agger, ‘material for the mound’ (see note on 2. 81, 2). The
mound is here distinguished from the palisade (‘ vallum') surmounting it.

1. 12. funestas. The darkness was ‘that of the grave,’ i.e. ominous
of their fate: ep. ‘feralibus . . . tenebria' 2. 31, 2.
