proconsulare ¹,' whereby, in contrast to those holding a more
liffi'i'ied' ‘ imperium? he was distinctively the sole ‘ imperator ²,'
or ‘ emperor,' of the Roman empire‚ and commander-in-chief of
all its fleets and armies, Not only the ‘legati' of his own
special province5‚ but also the proconsuls of those left to the
senate, ranked as his subordinates 3 and all military operations
were held by a fiction to be conducted under his ‘ auspicia⁸;’
while, by a further extension‚ this power was valid also in Italy
and even ⁸within the walls of Rome, giving him not only the
supreme command of the home army and police, but also power
of life and death over all citizenS‚ even of senatorial rank, and a
special Jurisdiction‚ whereby he could either try in person
criminal and civil charges of every description, or remit thern,
‘as' he thought fit, to other tribunals ⁴.

Hardly less important was the ‘ tribunitia potestas ⁵.’ In the
later time of the RepubliC, the office of tribune had been gener· ’
ally the most powerful urban magistracy, as that of proconsul
had been the chief title of military command ; and Caesar was
as much above ordinary tribunes as above ordinary proconsuls.
He held office for life, was hampered by the veto of no col-
league ⁶, and was known to be able, if need be, to support any⁴
coercive action by military force. From this office he derived
personal inviolability3 it was through it that he could summon
the senate and propose questions to it ⁷, as well as intervene to
forbid or modify any decree displeasing to him ⁸. Also, in this
capacity, he seems to have so far represented the people‚ that
the old civic right of ‘ provocatio ad populum ' from the sentence

¹ See on 1. 14, 4.
’ ² The use of this title, as commemorative of victories (see on 1. 9, 2),
is distinct from its.use to denote supreme command. The latter was
taken to be designated, in the case of most principeS‚ by the ‘praenomen
imperatoris 3 ’ which, however, was not borne by Tiberius.

to Augustus on the victories of his stepsons (Od. 4. 14, 43), ‘te copias,
te consilium et tuos Ι praebente Divos?

⁸ A colleague in this power was only at times appointed, and only
one whom the princeps felt that he could trust: see 1. 3, 3 ; 3. 56, 3.
