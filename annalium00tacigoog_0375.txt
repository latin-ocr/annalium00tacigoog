NOTES. Boos( JV. CHAPS. 28-33· 361

velut eluctantium verborum: genit. of quality ; ‘one whose
words seemed to struggle for utterance.’

l. 27. solutius, ‘with less restraint.'

l. 29. arceretur=‘arcendus censeretur ε’ cp. c. 20, 2 ; 3. 23, 2. This
sentence would be far less severe than deportation to an island.

convictus . . . cepisse: for this construction, cp. Introd. p. 15, § 29.

1. 31 . iure iurando obstringeret. For this phrase, cp. 1. 14, 6 ς and
for the practice of voting on oath, c. 21, 53 1. 74, 5.

, e republica: cp. 2. 33, 2, etc.

1. 32. aspere acceptum, ‘ received with indignation ⁹ by the opinion
of the senators: so ‘ accipere aliquid mollius,’ etc.‚ 2. 3ο, 2; 3. 68, 1.

vertit, intrans„ as in 1. 18, 3, etc. ε ‘ turned to his eredit!

P. 183, 1. 3. tamquam: cp. c. 13, 3.

1. 4. ut rettuli, 2. 27, 2.

Ῑ. 9. c. 32. levia memoratu, ‘too slight to be mentioned!

l. 10. annales nostros. It is on the strength of this passage that
editors have entitled this work ‘ Annales ς’ but the stress is on ⁸ nostros?
and ‘annales' is to be taken generally, as in 3. 65, 1.

contenderit=‘ comparaverit.’ This use of the perf. subjunct. in
expressions of prohibition is rare in the third person (Zumpt 529, note).
veteres . . . res, enallage for ⁸ res veteris populi ’ (1. 1, 4).

1. 11. conposuere: cp. ‘res . . . compositae,’ 1. 1, 5.

l. 13. praeverterent, usually in dep. pass, as 2. 55, 6, etc.

l. 15. libero egressu. The opposition of ⁸ in arto ’ would suggest
that ‘egressu ’ may either mean ⁸ with room to expatiate ⁹ (great events
giving scope to grandeur of style); or that they could escape from the
record of domestic matters when they pleased (as Tacitus could not),
and turn again to what was more interesting; or that the digression from
foreign to domestic matters„ at all was free, and not forced on them by
lack of the former.

in arte, ‘in a restricted field.’ Vergil uses ‘ in tenui labor’ (G. 4.
6), rather with a view to the thing on which the toil is spent.

l. 17. proferendi imperi incuriosus. A contrast is implied to the
conquests of Trajan: cp. c. 4, 63 2. 61, 2.

l. 1 9. magnarum . . . rerum motus oriuntur, ‘great events are setin

’ motion :’ cp. ‘ex parvis rebus saepe magnarum momenta pendent ’ (Liv.

27. 9, 1).
1. 21. o. 33. delecta ex iis, etc. Tacitus may probably allude to the
ideal mixed govemment conceived by Cicero (de Rep. 1. 29, 45, etc.).
1. 24. noscenda vulgi natura, sc. ‘erat :’ from this ‘noscendum’ is
to be supplied with ⁶ quibus.. . . haberetur.’
' l. 25. temperanter haberetur, ‘ might be discreetly controlled :’ cp.
⁸ molliter habitum‚' 1. 54, 4.
