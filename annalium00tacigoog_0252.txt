primane, etc. The construction is partly interrogative, partly
exclamatory.

l. 3ο. interfici centuriones, etc.: ep. c. 32, 33 35, 1. The ‘legati'
mentioned with the centurions and tribunes are probably the ‘legati
legionum! N either these nor the delegates of the senate are stated to
have been ‘ imprisoned ; ’ but the whole passage is rhetorical.

l. 31. precariam, ‘on sufferancez’ so ‘precaria vita,’ H. 4. 76, 5.

l. 33. c. 43. Cui· enim, etc. The thought is ‘I am living on suf-

all! The allusion is to the incidents described in c. 35, 5, 6.

P. 67, l. 2. melius, sc. ‘ fecit’ (see Introd. p. 14, 5 24).

1. 3. tot flagitiorum . . . conscius, ‘ implicated with my army in so

which Halm retains.

dividite. This verb is used by Tacitus (2. 43, 2; 3. 15, 3, etc),

in the sense of ‘secernere’

1. 19. excusavit, used here with accus. of the thing deprecated, else·
where with that of the person excused, the act apologised for, or the
plea alleged. From it, a verb of speaking is supplied with ‘venturum
