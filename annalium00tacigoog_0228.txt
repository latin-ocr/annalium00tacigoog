2 1 4 TA CJTUS .· ANNALS.

1. 15. sine ira et. studio. Tacitus believes himself able to keep clear of
all rancour or partiality, in speaking of princes with whom he had never
come in contact for good or evil.

l. 17. o. 2. publiea arma, ‘army of the Republic.⁸ It is implied that
the forces of the triumviri and of Sex. Pompeius were mere ‘privata arma.’

1. 18. oppressus, *was crushed' (so used of decisive defeat in 3. 41,
3, etc.). The defeat of Sex. Pompeius by Agrippa took place in ΒΕ. 36,
and Lepidus was at the same time ‘stripped of power,’ Caesar having
induced his whole army to desert him, after which he remained in seelu-
sion at Circeii till his death in B.C. 14.

, exuto: for the metaphorical uses of this verb, cp. c. 4, 13 59, 73
75,4; 2. 72, 13 3.12,4; 4. 72, 1, etc. .

1. 19. Iulianis, ⁸ Caesarian.’ After the death of the dictator, the
party of the triumvirS, as that of his friends, is still so designated ς that
of the senate or ‘ optimates ’ being similarly, even aster its leader’s death,
still called ‘Pompeian ’ (c. 10, 1).

1. 20. posito triumviri nomine, etc. The triumvirate lasted till
the end of 13.C. 33. From ΒΕ. 31 to 23, Caesar held a continuous series
of nine consulships (his third to his eleventh). The tribunician power
(see Introd. p. 24), though not assumed as a title till 13.C. 2 3, appears to
have been held by him in some form from 13.c. 36.

*2232* 1. 1. annona, i. e. ‘largitionibus annonae,’ by distributions of
corn, gratuitously or at low price (cp. 2. 87, 1).

1. 2. munia . . . legum, ‘ the functions of 1aw,’ in other words, the
sunction of virtual legislation through his edicts, rescriptS, etc.

L 3. ferocissimi, ‘ the boldest spirits ;’ used in a good sense, as is
also ‘ferocia’ (c. 12, 6).

per aoieS. The accuS. with ‘ per' has often in Tacitus the force
of a simple abl. or abl. with ‘ ex ’ or ‘ in,’ and is often interchanged with
such; see c. 7, 103 11, 73 4. 55, 7, etc.

1. 4. servitio, dative, as in c. 48, 33 4. 46, 4, etc.

1. 5. opibus et honoribus, abl. ε cp. c. 5, 1 ς ‘tollere honoribus? Hor.
Od. 1. 1, 8.

1. 6. tuta, etc. The stress is laid on the antithesis of ‘ tuta’ and
⁸ periculosa ι ’ ‘ preferred the new institutions with their security, to the
old with their periIS.' k

neque . . . abnuebant. There is much evidence that the provinces
were better off under the new govemment. See Introd. p. 29.

l. 8. certamina potentium. Some civ-il conflictS, as those of Marius
with Sulla, Pompeius with Caesar, had brought great distress on the
provmceS.

1. 9. ambitu, ‘intrigue’ or ‘solicitation’ (cp. c. 7, 103 75, 1); osten
used for bribery, but here distinguished from it (cp. 2. 34, Ι).
