¹· ΟΝ ΤΗΕ LIFE AND WORKS OF TACITUS; AND HIS
TREATMENT OF THIS PART OF HIS SUBJECT.

OUR knowledge of the chief facts and dates in the life of
Tacitus rests mainly* on allusions in his own writings and those
of 1115 friend the younger Pliny, who addresses several letters to
him and often speaks of him in otherS.

His praenomen is not mentioned in this correspondence, and
is differently given by later authorities as Gaius or Publius,
His family connexions are unknown 3 but he would appear to
have been the first of his name to attain senatorial rank, though
of sufficient position to have begun his ‘cursus honorum’ at the
earliest, or almost the earliest, legal age ; as he can hardly have
been born earlier than Α. D. 52—54, and must have been quaestor
not later than A. D. 79, by which time he had also received in

marriage the daughter of Agricola, who was already a consular,
and one of the first men in the State.

His boyhood falls thus under the time of Nero 3 his assump- ⁸

tion of the ‘ toga virilis’ would coincide, or nearly 50, with the
terrible year of Galba, Otho, and Vitellius ; his early manhood
was spent under Vespasian and Titus; the prime of 1115 life
under Domitian ; the memory of whose tyranny is seen in all
his historical writingS, which were composed at various dates in
the great tirne of Trajan.

Most os his lise may be supposed to have been spent in Rome,
where he became one of the leaders of the forensic bar, and one
of the best known literary names of Rome; so that a stranger
sitting next‘to him at the games, and finding him to be a man of
letters, asked whether he was speaking to Tacitus or to Pliny¹.
