1. 15. praevertit, ⁴ anticipated t'so ‘praevertit tristia leto: Lucan 8. 30.

1. 16. c. 20. tamen, i. e. though it was not customary to confiscate,
where the accused committed suicide before condemnation (see 6. 29, 2).

Asinii Galli ε cp. 1. 12,· 2, etc.; and, on Μ’. Lepidus, 1. 1-3, 2, etc.
partem, ⁸ half’ (cp. 3. 17, 8). Probably the property of Sosia alone
is here meant ; that of Silius having been already confiscated.

1. 22. quartam, sc. ‘ partem.' ’ We gather that the informer was
