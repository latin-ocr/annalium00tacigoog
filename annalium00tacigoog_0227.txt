NOTES.

BOOK 1.

P. 43, 1. 1. c. 1. Urbem Romam, etc. Tacitus here marks out the
chief periods of Roman Historyt—I. That of the kingS. 2. That of
the Republic (in which no permanent change of constitution took place
till the time of Augustus). 3. The principate. The enumeration is
introductory to the reasons given by him for choosing that particular
part of the third period which forms the subject of the Annals.

habuere, ‘governed; ’ so used of provinces in 4. 5, 2, etc.

1. 2. ad tempus, ‘for the occasion’ (πρὸς καιρόν), so ‘in tempus‚’
c. 37, 1, etc.

1. 3. neque . . . ultra biennium, etc. The decemvirate continued
through the greater part of a third year; but Tacitus probably follows
Livy and others in treating this part of its rule as a mere usurpation.
Military tribunes with consular power were substituted for consuls
during most of the years from ΒΩ. 444-367, but are not a fixed institu-
tion, as consuls or dictators frequently intervene. ΤΙιε ‘ despotism'
(⁸ dominatio ¹) of Cinna lasted during his four successive consulshipS,
B.C. 87—84; that of Sulla during his dictatorship, B.C. 82-79. The coali-
tion of ⁸ influence’ (‘potentia’) between Caesar, Pompeius, and Crassus,
often called the first triumvirate, is distinguished from the union of the
leaders of three armies (‘arma’) which brought about the second, or
true triumvirate.

l. 7. cessere, ‘ passed over to ’ (into the hands of). φ The verb is used
with a similar accus. in 2. 23, 33 also in 6. 43, 1 (⁸ omnes in unum ce·
debant ').

nomine principis, etc. On this title, and on the ‘imperium’ con-
nected with it, see Introd. p. 23.

1. 9. elaris scriptoribus. On this dat„ and on the gerundive dat.
aster ‘ defuere,’ see Introd. pp. 10, 11, §5 8, 11. Such an expression as
‘dicere tempora,' though found in earlier prose, is mainly poetical.

1. 10. donee . . . deterrerentur. On the use of the subjunct. os
facts with ‘donec’ (cp. c. 13, 73 32, 43 2. 6. 5, etc.), see Roby, 1670.

l. 1 2. res, used here not of actions themselves, but of the history of such
actions, which, while they lived, was ‘ falsified ’ (⁶ falsae ’).

1. 15. cetera, i. e. to the death of Nero, after which the Histories,
which Tacitus had already published, began.
