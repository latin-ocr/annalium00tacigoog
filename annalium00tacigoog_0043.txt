HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION TQ THESE BOOKS. 29

among these are Upper and Lower Germany and Syria, each
with its garrison of four legions ¹, those of the German armies
fully organized and trained by war against the unsubdued tribes
beyond the Rhine, and those of Syria charged with maintaining
the prestige of Rome against Parthia.

Another claSS, corresponding to the second class of senatorial
provinceS, comprised those in which only a single legion, or
even a smalle‘r force, was stationed. In these the legatus was
usually only of praetorian rank, but had otherwise the same
status as in the greater provinces, As an example of such may
be taken the main divisions of Gaul, Gallia Belgica, Lugdunen-
sis, and A‘quitania; for all of which insignificant forces seem
ordinarily to have su‘fficed‚ with the German legions in reserve
in case of a rising ².

In a third class of provinces of still less importance, the pro-
curator, of only equestrian· rank, instead of being placed under
a legatus, is himself the acting governor, perhaps usually in
some subordination to the legatus of a neighbouring province.
One well-known instance of such 'a government in the time of
Tiberius, that of Pontius Pilatus in Judaea, shows that an officer
even of this rank might have command of at least a cohort ⁸.

Egypt, as the ,great granary of Rome, had an exceptional
position, and, though held by a considerable force, was entrusted
to no legatus, but jealously retained by the princeps under his
own control ⁴, with a vicegerent of equestrian rank styled ‘prae-
fectus?

All governors of provinces had fixed salaries from the trea-
sury ; and cruelty and extortion, though by no means things of
the past, enjoyed far less impunity than such as collusive ac·
cusers‚ or judges interested in connivance, had often secured for
the culprit in former times, From this cause, probably also from
' the more equitable assessment of tribute through a systematic
censuS, the provinces are admitted to have been gainers by the
fall of the Republic ⁶, and there is evidence that those placed

under Caesar were more economically governed than the sena-
torial ⁶. ‘
