quartem, though here two were in the same town, and possibly in dis-
tinct portions of a common enclosure.

1. 33. religione. Eagles are called ‘legionum numina ' (2. 17, 2);
and the ‘ principia' (see on c. 61, 3), where the standards were kept,
had also the image of the ⁸ princeps ' (see 4. 2, 4) and the altar for
sacrifice (the ‘altaria deum ' here spoken of).

5 1. 2. rarum, etc.. parenthetical: see Introd. p. 20, ξ 51.
4. noscebantur, ‘ were capable of recognition : ⁹ cp. 4. 62, 5.

1. 5. imperat recepitque. Such interchange of the historical present
with a perfect is seen in 2. 7, 1 3 2ο, 2, etc.

l. 6. fatalem. This epithet‚ explained by ‘deum ira,’ softens the
censure conveyed in ‘ increpans ’ by treating them as hardly responsible
beings. The sense of ‘dicens ⁹ is supplied from ‘ increpans' with ‘re-
surgere.’

1. 8. ius legationis, ‘ the privilege of ambassadors ε ’ cp. ‘ sacra
legationiS‚’ c. 42, 4. Here the construction is pregnant (see Introd.
p. 20, ξ 53), such a word as ‘violatum ’ being implied with ‘iusl '

l. 11. c. 40. Eo in metu, etc„ ‘in this panic all blamed Germanicus :'
⁴ metus ’ may mean ‘ circumstances causing sear,’ as in 2. 72, 2, etc.

daughters yet unborn. Tiberius would be the adoptive ‘ avus ’ of the
child.

l. 18. diu cunctatus, etc. It is meant that he hesitated long to
advise her, and that she was long in consenting: the clause ‘ cum . . .
testaretur ’ explains ‘ aspemantem.'

1. 19. degenerem. This word appears to originate with Vergil: ‘ ad
pericula ’ = ‘ ad pericula subeunda.’

l. 21. incedebat, ‘ was starting on foot,’ without such vehicles as
women of rank generally used. ‘ Muliebre ' and ‘ miserabile ’ are also
emphatic.

l. 24. qui manebant, the husbands and friends parting from them.

1. 26. c. 41. facies, sc. ‘facies rerum (cp. c. 49, 1) non florenti
Caesari, sed urbi captae conveniens erat.’

l. 27. advertere, ‘attractedz’ so in 2. 17, 2; 4. 21, 5, etc.

progrediuntur contuberniis : cp. ‘ progredior portu,' Verg. Aen.
3. 3003 and for other such uses, see Introd. p. 11, § 13.

quis ille, etc. The exclamations are vividly put in their abrupt-
ness‚ without grammatical construction (as perhaps in c. 35, 2). After
‘ triste,' it is possible that some such word as ‘ spectaculum ' or ‘ iter’
