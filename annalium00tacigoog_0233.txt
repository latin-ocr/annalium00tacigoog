1. 22. dabat et famae, ‘it was his concession to public opinion.⁸
Horace has‘ das aliquid famae’ (Sat. 2. 2, 94); and here the object of
the verb is supplied by the clause‘ ut. .videretur.'

vocatus electusque. It should be remembered that the formal
choice of a princeps by the senate was at this time so sar a reality that
there was no precedent of hereditary succession.

l. 23. per uxorium ambitum, etc.‚ i. e. ‘ through the adoption osa
dotard‚ procured by the intrigue osa woman ’ (see the statement in 4.
57, 4)-

1. 31. Augustum, adj., as in ‘mensis Augustua’ etc.: so ⁸ nomen
Sempronium' (c. 53, 8), ‘ Furium’ (2. 52, 7), etc. Henceforth Tacitus
calls her ‘Augusta,’ or in full ‘ Iulia Augusta’ (as in 5. 1, 1).

in spem secundam, sc. ‘scripserat' or perhaps ‘adsumeban'tur ε ’
‘spes secunda’ is an elegance of expression for ‘heredes secundi: ‘heirs
in default‚’ should Tiberius and Livia have died before him. The
‘nepotes’ are Germanicus and DrusuS, the ‘pronepotes ’ the three sons
of the former.

1. 33. sed iaetantia-etc. This was set down to ostentation, as the
existence of so many heirs before them made their position an empty
compliment. The construction is similar to that of ⁶ sed quo,' etc. (c. 3,

H. S. was left ‘populo ' (generally taken to mean the public treasury),
and 3} millions to the tribes, i. e. 100,000 H. S. for distribution among
the poorer members of each tribe. There is, however, some reason to

l. 3. urbanis quingenos. From a statement to this effect in Sue-
tonius, it is thought that these words must have been omitted in the
MS. of TacituS. On the praetorian and urban cohorts, see 4. 5, 5.
