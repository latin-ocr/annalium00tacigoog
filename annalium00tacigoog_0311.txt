Babylon would seem near each other.

1. 4. triginta. Germanicus died in his thirty—fourth year, Alexander in
his thirty-third.

1. 5. suorum insidiis. The speakers assume the guilt of Piso, per-
haps even of Tiberius and Augusta. The similar tale of poisoning, in

this comparison of characters ; and it is assumed that Alexander was

1. 7. certis, ‘legitimatess

1. 8. etiam si, etc. Itis insinuated that Alexander succeeded only by
fortune aiding rashness; and that the conquests of Germanicus would
have been as complete, if he had been subject to no control from othere.
That the Germans were on the point of yielding is asserted in c. 26, 2.

body, and foam at the mouth, and the fact that the heart would not
burn. ‘Sepulturae ’=‘ cremationi:’ cp. e. 83, 3.

some appointment had to be made pending the decision of Caesar.

l. 20. 'Vibium Marsum et Cn. Sentium. The former (cp. 79, 1;
4. 56, 3) is known as a man of letters, and as having narrowly escaped
