l. 9. ouius e domo. It is to be understood that her property would
escheat to the fiscus, unless some one could show that she was a freed-
woman, or of such origin, and that his family were her ‘patroni ς’ we
also gather that Lepidus (probably the one-mentioned in 3. 32, 2, etc.)
had set up such a claim, but had not clearly proved it.

1. 11. in parte, ‘to half the property.’ Later, such legacies of a
portion to the princeps were often given to induce him to respect the

et, instancing a case, as in 3. 38, 1.

l. 31. sororis Augusti neptem. It is thought that her mother was

l. 2. distingui, ‘ that distinctions be drawn respecting! The context
shows what distinctions are meant.
