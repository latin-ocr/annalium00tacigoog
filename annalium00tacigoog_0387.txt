NOTES. BOOK JV. CHAPS.53-57. 373

l. 19. nam Tyrrhenum, etc. This legend is given in nearly the same
form by Herodotus (1. 94). The tradition is recognised by Vergil (Aen.
8. 479) and Horace (Sat. 1. 6, 1).

1. 22. vocabula=‘nomina :’ cp. 1. 3, 7.

per . . . in, interchanged merely for variety (Introd. p. 20, ξ 54 a).

1. 23. adhue=‘insuper,’ as in 1. 17, 5.

1. ²4· Pelope. Some legends give Pelops a Lydian, others a Phrygian
origin.

1. 28. c. 56. repetita vetustate, ‘ having retraced (cp. 3. 24, 2) their
antiquity.’

l. 3ο. transcendere, ‘ passed on?

ad ea quis . . . officiis. Such an attraction of the subject into the
case of a following relative is mainly poetical (Madv. 319, Obs. 3 Roby,
1067); but instances are found in Cicer0. In sense, ‘ officia' is rather
to be supplied as in apposition than as in agreement witn ‘ea ’ (⁸ what
they mostly relied on, namely their services ’).

1. 31. externa, the war with Antiochus (B.C. 191-188); the war in
Italy must have been the Social war (Β. C. 90-87).

1. 33. Μ. Porcio, Cato, the censor, who was cos. in B.C. 195.

P. 197,1. 2. validis . . . regibus3 e.g. before Antiochus had been
weakened by the war above mentioned.

1. 3. gravissimo in discrimine ς in the first Mithridatio war

(B.C. 84).
“ l. 5. in contionem nuntiatum (cp. c. 25, 2), a Greek construction,
like εἰσήγγελλον εἷς τὴν βουλήν (Isoc.).
qui adstabant. For the indic„ cp. c. 10, 2, etc.
1. 8. Vibius Marsus: cp. 2. 74, 1.
Μ’. Lepido: cp. 1. 13, 2.

1. 9. super numerum legaretur, ‘ a supemumerary legate should be
appointedss besides the regular staff of three.

l. 13. c. 57. abscessit. The MS. has no verb, but most editors con-
sider the insertion of one here necessary; though such verbs are often
omitted in epistolary writing or rapid narrative.

1. 14. certus . . . degere, a poetical construction (Verg. Aen. 4„ 564,
etc.)‚ as is that in c. 34, 2.

l. 1¹7. coniunxit, probably = ‘continuavit,’ as ‘abstinentiam cibi
coniunxit’ (6. 26, 3); a sense grounded on that in c. 33, 3, and here
equivalent to ‘ sex annos continuos mansit.’ ‘pari secreto ’ may be an
extension of the local abl. or possibly abl. of quality.

1. 18. permoveor, sc. ⁸ ad dubitandum ε’ cp. Introd. p. 2ο, ξ 53.

l. 20. habitum: cp. 1. 10, 7. In earlier life his bearing is described
as stiff and erect 3 and mention is made of ‘crebri et subiti tumores ' on
his countenance, which was otherwise handsome.
