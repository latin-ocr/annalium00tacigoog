14 INTRODUCTJON.

22 [34]. 'I'he genit. of quality is often used with the same
brachylogy as the corresponding abl. (ξ 17); as Lentulus senec·
tutis extremae 4. 29, 1 ; velut eluctantium verborum 4. 31, 4.

23 [37]. 'I'he gerundivo genit. (see the corresponding dat.
§ 11) is used oftener by Tacitus than by any other author, and
with especial frequency in the Annals ς sometimes with the force

of a genit. of quality3 as bellum abolendae infamiae 1. 3, 63 ·

often, by a more distinctly Tacitean usage, to qualify, not any
expressed noun, but the whole sentence (R. 1288); as Aegyptum
proficiscitur, cognoscendae antiquitatis 2. 59, 1 : so vitandae sus-
picionis 3. 9, 23 ostentandae virtutis 3. 41, 4. This usage is
perhaps a Graecism, from such constructions as τὸ ληστικὸν
καθήρει, τοῦ τὰς προσόδους μᾶλλον ἱέναι αὐτῷ (ThUC. Ι. 4).

ΙΙΙ. VERBS.

¹ ²4 [38]. Tacitus uses more treedom than classica] writers
in the omission of verbs of speaking (as in 1. 9, 4 ; 38. 3 ; 41,
2), thinking (as in 2. 5, 3), moving, or acting (as in 1. 43, 1 ; 4.
38, 5), when they can be supplied from the sense or context,
especially in lively descriptions or rhetorical passageS.

25 [39]. Other parte of the verb ‘ esse ’ than the present
indie. or infin. are often omittedg as ‘ erat,' ‘ erant,’ &c.‚
especially in relative or dependent clauses; as in cuius manu
1. 7, 9 3 ubi crematus 2. 83, 3 3 donec id vetitum 4. 74, 6 (cp. 1.
69, 2 ; 3. 26, 3); also ‘fore‚’ in 2. 15, 33 and ‘fuisse,’ as in 2.
31 , 4 3 73, 4 3 3. 16, 1, ὅτε. The subjunctive of this verb is also
freely omitted, when another subjunct. follows, as in 1. 9, 1 3 35,
1 ; 65, 1, &C., and in oratio obliqua, as in 1. 11, 23 4. 39, 4.

26 [40]. 'rho poetica] use of simple verbs for eompound
is especially abundant in the Annals, where nearly forty verbs
so used are noted. In the first Book alone may be instanced
ardescere 73, 1 ; asperare 72, 53 firmare 71, 5 ; gravescere 5, 1 ;
notescere 73, 33 piare 42, 2 ; ponere (·= proponere) 7, 5 3 solari
