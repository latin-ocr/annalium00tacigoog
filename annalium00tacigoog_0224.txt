of coldness or suspicion on the part of TiberiuS, appear to have
precipitated Seianus into a plot to secure his end by assassination.
This conspiracy came to the ears of Antonia, and was by her
revealed to Tiberim, who laid his plan' with consummate craft.
On the 17th of October, Naevius Sertorius Macro brought with
him to Rome his own commission as praefect of the praetorians
(with a liberal donative to secure the acquiescence of the
soldiers), and a ‘ long, wordy letter’ ¹ to be read next day in the
senate. Measures were concerted with Memmius Regulus, one
of the consuIS, whose loyalty could be entirely depended upon 3
Seianus was lulled into security by being led to suppose that the
announcement would be that of his appointment to= share the
tribunician power of the prince, was denounced as a traitor in
the letter, hurried from the senate to the ,dungeon, and there, on
the same day, executed, and his body dragged through the streets
to be flouted by high and low. His eldest son and, subsequently,
even his two other children of tender years, his uncle Junius
Blaesus, ² and otherS, shared his fate, and many more were
thrown into prison to await their' trial. His divorced wife
Apicata committed suicide, but, before doing so, gave information
of the murder of Drusus eight years previously ⁸0 “ The news of
this hitherto unsuspected crime filled Tiberius with horror3
further investigations and more arrests took place, and Livia,
the guilty wife of Drusus, was executed or forced to despatch
herself.

The domestic history of the remaining years of Tiberius is
little more than that of a prolonged reign of terror. He is
described as never tired of tortures and triaIS, and never satisfied,
even as stimulated by them to further carnage‚ like a wild beast
that has tasted blood. The compliant senate was generally made
his instrument, and condemned, often without form of trial, on a
mere missive from Capreae. Informers multiplied on every side3
even the highest stooped to save themselves by denouncing
others or voting for their death.

The number executed or forced to suicide during this whole
