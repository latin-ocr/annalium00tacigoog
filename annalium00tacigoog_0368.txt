1. 18. neque adesse, etc. The whole passage gives two reasons for the
scarcity of candidates3 the first being that few were born of ‘confarreati
parentes ;' the second, that the loss of ‘patria potestas ’ was objected to (‘et

Ramsay, Manual of Roman AntiquitieS‚ p. 247. Besides the ⁸ flamen

such offices, and the persons chosen might lose the fmits of a profitable
adoption.

1. 23. quaeque . . . conveniret. ⁶ Conventio in manum,' whereby

such as ‘ confarreatio ' (see Ramsay, p. 2 5 1) 3 and the flamen was obliged
to have a wife, and to have been married to her by this ceremony.

1. 27. sacrorum causa. The wife of the flamen had public duties as
priestess of Jun0. By the fiction here proposed she was to be so far
A treated as if she had complied with the full ceremonies of marriage as
to be enabled to perform these duties legally; but was to be otherwise
as other women, who in those days usually were married ⁶ sine couven-
tione,’ and thereby gained considerable independence.

1. 31. caerimonias, ‘ the duties of a religious office!
