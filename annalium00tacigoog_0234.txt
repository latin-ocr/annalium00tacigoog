220 TA CITUS .· ANNALS.

1. 4. cohortibus civium Romanorum. Such bodies are recorded
in inscriptionS, but not mentioned by Tacitus in his summai-y of the
forces of the empire (4. 5). They would belong to no legion, but would
have otherwise the legionary status. The force of ‘ aut ’ is equivalent to
that of ‘ et vicissim.'

1. 5. ex quis, etc. By the insertion of ‘qui ’ the sentence is made 10
run as if it had been written ‘ex quibus eOS, qui maxime insignes visi,
Gallus Asinius et L. Arruntius censuere ; ’ but a complication is intro-
duced by the attempt to express also in the same ⁴ sentence the substance
of each decree. ‘Visi’ refers to the opinion entertained at the time.
Gallus and Arruntius are very often mentioned in these Books (see c. 123
13, etc.).

1. 6. porta triumphali, abl. of direction (Introd. p. 11, ξ 14). This
gate was probably closed except at triumphS.

l. 9. Messala Valerius, elsewhere called Valerius MessalinuS, and
stated to be son of the famous orator Corvinus (3. 34, 2).

1. 13. ea sola species, etc., i. e. this show of independence was the
only form of flattery not stale.

1. 15. remisit, etc. They had put it as a ‘duty’ (⁴ ferendum ’), and
Caesar, ‘with haughty condescension, excused (or released) them’ from
such service, as if it rested with him to insist on it or not. His expres-
sion may have been such as still to leave them free 10 (10 11 if they
pleased‚ and according to other accounts the corpse was borne by sena·
tors to the pyre.

1. 17. funus divi Iulii. On that occasion, after the speech of An·
tonius in the Forum, the people had hastily collected materials and
bumt the body in that place, instead of on the pyre prepared, according
to custom, outside the walls, in the Campus Martius: other acts of
violence had also been committed.

1. 21. crudi adhuc servitii, ‘when slavery was yet unripe,’ not ma·
tured by long subservience.

1. 22. occisus . . . Caesar, ‘ the assassination of Caesar.’ On this use
of the participle, see Introd. p. 16, ς 36.

l. 24. in rempublicam‘ against the commonwealthz’ so in 3. 24, 2.
The resources were those given under his will.

1. 27. c. 9. plerisque, ‘the majorityss as opposed 10 the‘ prudentes?

vana, ‘triflesss i. e. mere accidents, such as follow.

1. 28. idem dies, Aug. 19, the day of his first election to the consul·
ship, B.C. 43. γ

1. 30. numerus consulatuum, etc. Marius had been seven times,
Valerius Corvus six times, Augustus, thirteen times, consul. His years
of tribunician power count only from his formal assumption of the title,
