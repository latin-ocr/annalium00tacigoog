NOTES. BOOK I. CHAPS. 1-3. '215

1. 1 1. o. 3. subsidia dominationi, accus. in apposition: see Introd.
. 10, ξ 5 a. ·

p Marcellum, etc. For the relationships of all the persons men·
tioned in this chapter, and the dates of their deaths, see the genealogies
(Introd. pp. 32-34). Marcellus is best known from the famous lines of
Vergil (Aen.'6. 861, foll.). He held the curule aedileship, his first and
only mag-istracy, in his twentieth year, which was also that of his death
(13.0. 23).

1. 14. geminatis, ‘ piled one upon another,’ i. e. ‘consecutive ς’ refer-
ring to the second and third consulships of Agrippa, B.C. 28, 27. No
subsequent instances of this are found except in the case of the princeps
himself or his nearest relatives.

1. 16. imperatoriis nominibus. This title was similarly given by
Tiberius to Germanicus (c. 58, 9), and was merely honorary, as when
given by victorious soldiers to their general (see on c. 9, 2; 3. 74, 6).

1. 17. integra, ‘furnished with heirs:' cp. ‘plena domus,’ 4. 3, 1.

1. 19. appellari, destinari . . . cupiverat, equivalent to ‘ appellati,
destinati, . . . id quod cupiverat.' The title of ‘ princeps iuventutis,’
apparently then first invented, was analogous to that of ‘ princeps
senatuS,’ and denoted them as first in the ⁸ centuriae equitum Romano-
rum.‘ It was held apparently by Germanicus (see on 2. 83, 5), and
afterwards by Nero, Gaius was consul in his twentieth year (Aa). 1),
but Lucius never lived to fill that office.

l. 22. Armenia: on this abl. see Introd. p. 11, 5 13.

l. 24. illue cuneta vergere, ‘all set in that direction,’ i.e. all in-
fluence centred in him: for other metaphorical uses of ‘vergeress cp. 2.

1. 25. filius, etc. He was adopted by Augustus after the death of
Gaius (Am. 4), and afterwards associated with him in the command of
the armies and provinces, or ‘proconsulare imperium’ (Introd. p. 23).
He was a sharer in the tribunician power for more than fifteen years
during the life of Augustus (see on c. 10, 73 3. 56, 3).

l. 29. Planasiam, Pianosa‚ near Elba.

sane, concessive, as c. 10, 2, etc. The words ‘ robore . . . ferocem’
are a close reminiscence of Livy (see Introd. p. 22, ὁ 58, 2) ; ‘ferox,' in
both places, meaning ‘confident’ ⁸ Conpertue’ in the sense of ‘found
guilty,' takes a genit. of the crime.

1. 31. hercule points the contrast (cp. c. 17, 73 26, 3, etc.) between
the failure of Livia in this case and her success in the other.

l. 1. filius, Drusus Caesar, probably some two years younger ⁶

than Germanicus, With ⁸ sed,’ such a verb as ‘fecit’ is supplied (see
Introd. p. 14, 5 ²4)-
1. 2. abolendae infamiae. On the gerundive genit. see Introd.
