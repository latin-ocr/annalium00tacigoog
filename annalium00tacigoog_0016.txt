He is further known¹ as having been consul suffectus and in
that capacity colleague with Nerva in Α. D. 96, and as associated
with Pliny in the prosecution of Marius Priscus, proconsul of
ι Africa, in Α. D. 100². .

The AnnaIS, more properly entitled ‘ Libri ab excessu divi
Augusti,' comprising, in sixteen Books ⁸, the history of fifty-four
years from the death of Augustus to that of Nero, are the latest
in date of all his writings, and are shown, by an allusion to the
Eastern conquests'of Trajan ⁴, to have been published at some
time not earlier than A.D. 115, and probably before the retro-
cession of the Eastern frontier under Hadrian in A. D. 117. The
first six BookS, comprising the whole principate of TiberiuS, rest
on a single manuscript, designated as the first Medicean, written
probably in the tenth or eleventh century, and now preserved at
Florence. What are given as various readings are the emenda·
tions of its errors and corruptions suggested by various editors,
sometimes with the aid of marginal and other corrections of un-
certain date in the manuscript itself.

In writing of the times of Tiberius, TacituS, who must himself
have been born some fifteen years after the death of that prince,
appears to have derived some information from the unwritten
recollections of his elders ⁵, but to have taken most of the ma-
terial from previous writers. In one passage he refers to the
history of the Roman wars in Germany by the elder Pliny⁶ , in
another to the memoirs of Agrippina the mother of Nero⁷, who
is thought to have supplied the historians of that age with most
of the domestic detail and court scandal which has passed cur-
rent with far too little question of its truth. Elsewhere, he often
refers to authors without naming them⁸ ,andis thought to have
been chiefly indebted to the works of M. Servilius N omanus,
who died in A. D. 59, and of Aufidius BassuS, whose date is
much the same. He may also have had before him biographies
of individuals, especially of GermanicuS, to whose achievements

ninth‚ and tenth, with parts of the eleventh and sixteenth, are lost.
