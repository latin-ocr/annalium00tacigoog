in Campaniam. His absence lasted till the next year (c. 64, 1).
His final departure was four years after that time (4. 57, 1).

1. 4. meditans, ‘praetising’ (= μελετῶν), as in the expressions ‘medi-
tari praelia‚' etc. (Vergil and Juvenal).

1. 7. Domitius Corbulo, probably the father of the famous general
who served under Claudius and Nero, It is possible that what is further
said of hi'm (ξ 7) belongs properly to the son.

l. 10. patrius mos. Cicero (de Inv. 1. 30, 48) cites the rule ‘ut
” maioribus natu adsurgatur ’ as part of the common usage of nations : cp.
his anecdote of the Lacedaemonians (de Sen. 18. 63) ; also Juv. 13. 55.

1. 15. patruu- simul ao vitricus. He must have been half-brother
to Sulla's {athen whose widow he must also have married, after having
divorced Lepida (cp. c. 23, 3).

l. 17. mancipum, ‘ contractors’ (⁴ redemptores’)‚ over whom the

1. 2 5 bello suffecturum, ‘who would be competent for war?
Sex. Pompeius: cp. c. 11, 2.

1. 26. Marcum Lepidum. This person must be carefully dis-
tinguished from Manius Lepidus (1. 13, 2, ete.,) with whom the MS. text

means in c. 72, 33 2.48, 1.

1. 27. etiam Asiae sorte, i. e. even from the lot for a peaceful pro·
vinee. Asia and Africa were usually thus disposed of to two senior
consulars (Introd. p. 28) ; but as the latter was now to be given ⁸ extra

Asia as matter of course; unless the senate or the princeps exercised
their power to prevent him from taking it.
