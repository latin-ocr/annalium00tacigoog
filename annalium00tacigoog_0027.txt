THE SYNTAX ΛΝΒ STYLE OF TACITUS. 13

D. Genz'n‘ve.

20 [32]. Partitive or quasi-partitive (R. 1296). Such geni-
tives are abundant in Tacitus 3 the partitive meaning being often
lost sight of, and the construction being equivalent, as in poetry
(e. g. ‘ strata viarum,’ &c.), to a simple subst. and adj,

(a) aster neut. sz‘ng.,· as umid0, lubrico paludum 1. 61, 23
65, 63 sometimes even after a case depending on a prep. 3 as in
prominenti litoris 1. 53, 7.

(b) ‘aster neut. pl„ still more frequently3 as cuncta curarum
3. 35, 2 3 tacita suspicionum 4. 41, 1.
(c) aster masc. orsam„ also frequently3 as with pauci, multi,

alii, &e.: also in such expressions as quinque consularium 3. 28,
6; leves cohortium 3. 39, 1.

(d) with adverbs; as eo furoris 1. 18, 23 huc adrogantiae
3· 73, 1. ·
21 [33], objectiva genitive (R. 1312).

(a) with verbs. It is peculiar to Tacitus to use such a genit.
with monere (1. 67, 1), on the analogy of its compoundS, and
with adipisci (3. 55, 1), on the analogy of potiri. He also ex·
tends the usage of an elliptical genit. with verbs of accusing or
judging to new examples3 as postulare 1. 74, 1 3 deferre 4. 42, 3.

(b) with partztzples, the frequency of such a genit. is cha-
racteristic3 e. g. with cupiens 1. 75, 43 inpatiens 2. 64, 43 in·
ψ tolerans 1. 31, 1 3 retinens 2. 38, 9 3 sciens 1. 64, 6.

(c) with adjectz'veS, the usage is also characteristic from its
extreme frequency; the genit. sometimes expressing direct object
(R. 1312), where the accus„ with participle might be substituted ’
(as with pavidus 4. 38, 1 3 providus 4. 38, 1, &c.)3 or amore
remote object (R. 1318), where the abl. with de would be usual
(as with ambiguus 1. 7, 4 3 certus 1. 27, 33 securus 3. 28, 3) 3
oftenest of all expressing (as in poets) the thing in point of
which a term is applied to a person (R. 1320) : animi is con-
stantly thus used (1. 32, 53 69, 2, &c.)3 and such a genit. is
found with manifestus 2. 85, 3 3 melior 3. 74, 1 3 modicus 2. 73,
33 occultus 4. 7, 23 pervicax 4. 53, 13 praeclarus 4. 34, 43
validus 4. 21, 5 3 vetus 1. 20, 2 3 and many others.
