l. 30. restinguendae, ‘to be cooled:' the metaphor of a fever is
carried through the sentence.

libidinibus, attracted for ‘libidines quibus.’ '
· l. 33. contemptim their recent date precluding the excuse of obli-
vion.
P. 155, l. 1. si prohibita. . . . transcenderis, ‘if you have passed
the forbidden line; ’ apparently a pregnant construction for ‘ transcen—
deris leges et prohibita feceris?

1. 4. unius urbis cives. In legal status they were still and always Α

such3 but the reference is apparently to the time before the great foreign
conquests (‘ externae victoriae '), when all Romans were really such in
home and nationality, and lived together as citizens, The sentence ‘ ne
. . . dominantibus ’ does not appear to distinguish another period, but to
add another reason: not only had men then more sels-control, but also
fewer temptations 3 as foreign luxuries were comparatively unknown.

1. 8. in levi, a common Greek construction z cp. οὐκ ἐν ἐλαφρῷ
(Theocr. 22. 213).

l. 18. exonerari, ‘ is being removed: ' so ‘multitudinem . . . exone-
ratum,‘ H. 5. 2, 3.

1. 20. me quoque non, ‘that neither am I.' ‘ Quoque non,’ like
‘ nec’ and ‘neque ' (see note on 2. 34, 7), has sometimes the force of ⁴ ne
. . . quidem?

1: 24. e. 55. remissa aedilibus talis eura, ‘the aediles were ex-
cused (cp. 1. 8, 6) from such a duty‚’ i. e. from that of an energetic
enforcetnent of the laws3 and luxury in feasting ran riot without check
till the death of Nero.

l. 25. arma =‘ bellum,’ more strictly ‘the time when arms were taken
up :' so ‘post arma . . . Vindicis,’ 15. 74, 2.

l. 26. adeptus, used with genit. by Tacitus alone3 the construction
being analogous to that of ‘ potior,’ and apparently taken from that of
