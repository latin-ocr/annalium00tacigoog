2 12 ⁴ APPENDIX.

On March 16, Α. D. 37, it was falsely reported that Tiberius
had breathed his last, and Gaius was already receiving the
homage of the court; when the news that the emperor had
suddenly revived and was canng for food turned the congratu-
lations into consternation and dismay. Macro alone preserved
presence of mind, and bade the attendants heap the bed-clothes
on the old man and leave the door. ¹ Such was the end of

Tiberius, in the seventy- -eighth year of his age, and the twenty-
third of his rule.

¹ This account of his death is that given by T acitus3 but other reports
also were current.
